<h2>Kent's Perl Programs for Data Tasks</h2>

<hr style="height: 2px; width: 100%; margin-left:0px;
margin-right:auto;"> The following programs are tools I've written
and reused over the years--some by only me, some shared among
coworkers. They're not polished software, but they work the way I need
them to. I'm sharing them 'as-is' with no guarantees. Feel free to copy,
use, or modify them, as long as you leave my name in the code. All
were developed on Unix systems (Solaris, FreeBSD), but they should run
fine on Windows and Mac OS X, too, if you have Perl available (such as
Strawberry Perl for Windows; Mac OS X has perl installed already). Perl
version 5 is assumed unless otherwise noted. 

<p>These programs were written
to work on raw ASCII data such as raw data files, program files, etc.

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a href="perl/freqperl.html">Compute frequency
counts</a></strong> for alphanumeric values in a column range.
Answers the question "how many times do the unique values in columns
<i>x</i> through <i>y</i> occur in this file?".</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>

<dt><strong><a href="perl/freq2perl.html">Frequency counts
w/percentages</a></strong> adds percentages &amp; cumulative percentages
to the frequency count program above. This output is more like what SPSS
frequencies produces.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>

<dt><strong><a href="perl/fixbperl.html">Block a stream data
file</a></strong> to fixed line length by inserting newlines at a
user-specified logical record length. Makes all the lines the same length
from a stream of data.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>

<dt><strong><a href="perl/scanperl.html">Report length of double-quoted 
strings</a></strong> in a text file (such as SPSS or SAS variable labels).
Used to keep commands within limits for strings.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>

<dt><strong><a href="perl/qscanperl.html">Report length of double-quoted and
single-quoted strings</a></strong> in a text file (such as SPSS or SAS variable 
labels). New version.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>

<dt><strong><a href="perl/todayperl.html">Print a calendar with today's date 
highlighted</a></strong> Assumes VT100-compatible terminal emulation and 
an available Unix 'cal' command. Mostly no longer needed since several
cal programs now have an option to highlight today's date.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>

<dt><strong><a href="perl/splitit.html">Split a multi-column SAS input or
SPSS data list statement</a></strong> into a single column. Useful for
reformatting another way.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>

<dt><strong><a href="perl/wrapit.html">Wrap a single column of SAS input or
 SPSS data list statements</a></strong> into multiple (5) columns. Fits more
statements on a line.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>

<dt><strong><a href="perl/cklgperl.html">Check a SAS log file for
errors, warnings and other issues</a></strong> Output is in QuickFix
format for use with the Vim editor.</dt>
<dd>Using Vim's QuickFix functions, the output of this program supports
jumping to the line of the error or warning in your SAS
log. Or you can use the output directly to guide your debugging.&nbsp;</dd>
<dt><strong><a href="perl/deblank.html">Turn multiple blank lines
into single blank lines.</a></strong> For example, if 3 blanks lines
are found in a file, this program will remove 2 of them and leave one
blank line.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>

<dt><strong><a href="perl/cktbperl.html">Check for trailing blanks
at the end of lines.</a></strong>It reports the number of blanks (spaces
or tabs) found on lines and the line with the longest string of blanks.
For places with no trailing blanks as a rule for programming, this
program will tell you if you need to fix anything in your files.</dt>

<dd>&nbsp;</dd>

<dt><strong><a href="perl/detabperl.html">Detab a file, two different
methods </a></strong>Detabbing in this context means replacing tabs
with spaces in a file.  The two methods are column-based and literal
replacement of tabs by a certain number of spaces.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
