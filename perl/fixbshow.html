# fixblock.pl -- block a data file to a fixed record length
#
#   This program is for fixing a data file that has no lineends, but
#   is supposed to be LRECL. Such data files often come from tape as
#   "stream files". The program reads records of LRECL-length and writes
#   them to a new file, with lineends.  Other programs that perform a
#   similar task are dd (difficult to use) and fold (doesn't put a line
#   end on the last line).
#
#   Note: most of this program is pretty-printing error and
#   usage messages.  The actual working code is one line of Perl
#   (while/sysread).  Tested with 'use strict' and -w.
#
#   --Kent Nassen, 11/30/95, 3/12/97, 8/12/98, and 9/22/98

# Syntax:  fixblock.pl -l# infile outfile
#    where # is the lrecl number of characters to block the file
#    All parameters on the command line are required.
