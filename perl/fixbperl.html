<h2>fixblock.pl -- Convert Stream File to Fixed Block File</h2>

<hr style="width=100%; height 2px; border: none;">

This is a Perl script to convert a &#34;stream&#34; data file,
in which all data is on one long line with no end of line delimeters,
into a fixed block data file with a constant logical record length
(LRECL).* This started as a one or two line perl hack with hard-coded
parameters, but after giving it to several coworkers, I found that it
required more hand-holding (like commandline parameters, usage messages,
error messages, etc.). Hence, it's quite a bit longer now, but the gist
of it is still one line of code.

<P>This small program has been useful for fixing files incorrectly read
from tape and some data files that have been received in stream format
via FTP. The program leaves the original data file in its original
format. <strong>NOTE</strong> that the script will fail to produce
useful output if, for example, trailing blanks on short data lines were
stripped before the input data file was put into stream format. Each
data line or record must be LRECL length even when in stream format, in
other words.

    <li><strong>Download: </strong> <a href="fixblock.pl"><b>fixblock.pl</b></a></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Assuming this program is executable its commandline is:
<p>
<span style="color: #000080;">fixblock.pl -l# infile outfile</span>
<p>
where:<BR> 
<ul>
    <li><i>-l#</i> sets the LRECL desired to # characters</li>
    <li><i>infile</i> is the stream file to be processed</li> 
    <li>and <I>outfile</i> is the file to which the blocked output will be sent.</li>
</ul>
<p>
As an example of usage, the command <span style="color: #000080; font-family: monospace;">fixblock.pl
-l5 test.dat test.out</span> with an input file, test.dat (one line
with no line-end character) consisting of:
<pre>12345123451234512345123451234512345</pre> 

will produce this output in test.out:

<pre>
12345
12345
12345
12345
12345
12345
12345
</pre>

The user will see the following output on the screen:

<pre>
(pts/1):~&gt; fixblock.pl -l5 test.dat test.out

fixblock.pl: Done!
7 records processed from 'test.dat'

Output is in 'test.out'
</pre>

<p>
* Yes, there are other ways to do this sort of conversion--such as
<i>dd</i>, but most users have trouble with that one. The GNU program
task, but it does not end the last line of the file with a newline
character. The <i>/usr/bin/fold</i> program from Sun also seems to have
this characteristic.  I needed a program that would add a newline even
on the last line of the program.  There are instances, however, when
the 'fold' behavior is useful, also.
