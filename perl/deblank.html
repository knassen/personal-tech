<h2>deblank: Turns multiple blank lines into single blank lines</h2>

This shell script will go through an ASCII text file and remove multiple blank
lines, leave a single blank line.  I've added Perl detection of non-ASCII
characters in the file so that an external program is not necessary as long
as you have Perl available.


<pre><code>

 -------------------------------------------------------------
  deblank: Turns multiple blank lines into single blank lines
 -------------------------------------------------------------
     
 Needed a filename (and only one filename) to convert!
 If more than one filename is given, the second and
 succeeding files will be ignored. (You may, however, redirect
 the output to a file).
         
    Usage:
          deblank [filename]

</code></pre>
<p>
Assume we have a small text file with some blank lines in it.  If we want
to remove duplicate or multiple blank lines, deblank will do the job.
