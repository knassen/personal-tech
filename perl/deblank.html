    <h2>deblank: Turns multiple blank lines into single blank lines</h2>

<hr style="height: 2px; width: 100%; margin-left:0px; margin-right:auto;">

This shell script will go through an ASCII text file and remove multiple
blank lines, leaving a single blank line from each sequence of blank
lines.  I've added Perl detection of non-ASCII characters in the file
so that an external program is not necessary as long as you have Perl
available. 
<p>
The programming problem is to remove the second and following
blank lines, but leave the first blank line. The sed command used does
this by finding a blank line, then going to the adjacent blank line and
removing it, etc.  The program uses a check for a file we can run this
operation on by testing for a binary file before doing the sed command.
See the code linked below.

 <h3>Usage</h3>

  The usage is simple: 

   <span style="font size: 115%;"><strong>deblank [filename...]</strong></span>

  An example run is shown below. First the command is run with
  no filename and it gives a usage message in that case. Then it
  is run on a text file with blank lines mixed with text.

<pre>

 -------------------------------------------------------------
  deblank: Turns multiple blank lines into single blank lines
 -------------------------------------------------------------
     
 Needed a filename (and only one filename) to convert!
 If more than one filename is given, the second and
 succeeding files will be ignored. (You may, however, redirect
 the output to a file).
         
    Usage:
          deblank [filename]

</pre>
<p>
Assume we have a small text file with some blank lines in it.  If we want
to remove duplicate or multiple blank lines, deblank will do the job.

</pre>
Above, deblank has removed multiple blank lines and left one blank line
from sets of multiple blank lines.
