<h2>cklg.pl -- Scan a SAS log for errors, warnings, and other issues</h2>
<hr style="width=100%; height 2px; border: none;">

I wrote this Perl program to do a faster scan through one or more SAS log
files than I could do by pulling them into an editor and paging through
them. The script, on Unix/Linux, can be run on multiple log files. The
output is set up to allow the use of vim's Quick Fix facility. Adding more
search terms is easy. Just add them to the @search array like the others.

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This program is intended to be run from a Unix or Linux command line.</li>
    <li>Output is sent to STDOUT, so redirect it to a file to save it.</li>
    <li>Not all issues this program finds are labeled as errors or warnings.</li>
    <li>The output is formatted so that it can be used with Vim's QuickFix facility.</li>
</ul>

    <li><strong>Download: </strong> <a href="cklg.pl"><strong>cklg.pl</strong></a></li>


<h3>Usage</h3>
Assuming this program is executable, its commandline is:
<span style="font size: 115%;"><strong>cklg.pl [SAS log filename...]</strong></span>
where: <br>
<ul>
    <li>                    -h    Display this usage message</li>
    <li>                    -l    List the search terms</span></li>
</ul>

As an example, the command <span style="color: #000080; font-family: monospace;"> cklg testdate2.log</span>
might produce output like:

<pre><code>~/sas> cklg testdate2.log
testdate2.log:33:ERROR 22-322: Syntax error, expecting one of the following: !, !!, &, *, **, +, -, /, ;, <, <=, <>,
testdate2.log:40:NOTE: Character values have been converted to numeric values at the places given by: (Line):(Column).
testdate2.log:42:NOTE: The SAS System stopped processing this step because of errors.
testdate2.log:43:WARNING: The data set WORK.TEST2 may be incomplete.  When this step was stopped there were 0
testdate2.log:45:WARNING: Data set WORK.TEST2 was not replaced because this step was stopped.</code></pre>
