<h2>cktb -- Check for trailing blanks (spaces, tabs) in a file</h2>
<hr style="height: 2px; width: 100%; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: auto;">

<a href="cktb.pl"><strong>cktb.pl</strong></a> is a Perl program which
checks for trailing blanks (space or tabs) in a text file and reports
the number found and the longest string of blanks found. This is useful
for data prep, scripting, and version control where you want clean copies
of files.
<p>
This program was written because one place I worked didn't want any
programs with spaces or tabs at the end of any line. So this program
checks for that issue. It's easier to get a report where this issue is
found than trying do it in your editor (although some editors can get
find spaces at the end of the lines, like vim). If you can do that,
more power to you. And if anyone thinks they've gotten rid of them 
you can show them a report from this program.
<p>
Yes, it's a relatively simple program but you would not believe the number
of times it proved that even though people did their best to get rid of
trailing white space in their programs, there was still some there. A
program like this makes all the difference in proving it. If you're a 
programmer, that's something worth writing a program for! And others can
use it to check their programs for trailing white space.

<h3>Limitations:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This is written in Perl so needs Perl available.</li>
    <li>It is a command line program and would generally run on Linux or Unix.</li>
    <li>It is intended to scan through text files, in particular, programs, but
        could be used for other purposes.
    <li>The program only reports the locations of trailing blanks. It is left to
        the user to remove them, if desired. (In theory, there shouldn't be many. If
        there are many lines like that, tell them to go back and fix it again)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<span style="color: #000080; font-family: monospace;">     cktb.pl [-l] filename [filename...]</span>
where: <span style="color: #000080; font-family: monospace;"> -l </span>gives long output, 
instead of a summary.
<p>
For example, here is a file with some trailing white space and what the
report will show. I've marked the end of the lines with the vertical
bars ("|") so you can see there is some white space of varying lengths
on a few of the lines.
