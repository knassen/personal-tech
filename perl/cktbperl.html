<h3>cktb -- Check for trailing blanks (spaces, tabs) in a file</h3>
<hr style="height: 2px; width: 100%; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: auto;">

<a href="perl/cktb.pl.txt"><B>cktb.pl</b></a> is a perl program
which checks for trailing blanks (space or tabs) ina file and
reports the number found and the longest string of blanks found.

This was written because one place I worked didn't want any spaces or
tabs at the end of each row in a program. So this program checks for it.
It's easier to get a report where this issue is found than trying do it
in your editor (although some editors can get rid of spaces at the end
of the lines, like vim). And if anyone thinks they've gotten rid of them
you can show them a report.

<p>
<strong>Limitations:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>This is written in Perl so needs Perl available.
    <li>It is a command line program and would generally run on Linux or Unix.


</ul>

<h3> Usage </h3>

<span style="color: #000080; font-family: monospace;">     cktb.pl [-l] filename [filename...]</span>
where: <span style="color: #000080; font-family: monospace;"> -l </span>gives long output, 
instead of a summary.
<p>
For example, here is a file with some trailing white space and what the
report will show.
