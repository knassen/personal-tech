<h3>cktb -- Check for trailing blanks (spaces, tabs) in a file</h3>
<hr style="height: 2px; width: 100%; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: auto;">

<a href="cktb.pl"><strong>cktb.pl</strong></a> is a Perl program which
checks for trailing blanks (space or tabs) in a text file and reports
the number found and the longest string of blanks found.

This program was written because one place I worked didn't want any
programs with spaces or tabs at the end of any line. So this program
checks for it.  It's easier to get a report where this issue is found
than trying do it in your editor (although some editors can get find
spaces at the end of the lines, like vim). And if anyone thinks they've
gotten rid of them you can show them a report from this program.

Yes, it's a relatively simple program but you would not believe the number
of times it proved that even though people did their best to get rid of
trailing which space in their programs, there was still some there. A
program like this makes all the difference in proving it.

    <li><strong>Download: </strong> <a href="cktb.pl"><strong>cktb.pl</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This is written in Perl so needs Perl available.</li>
    <li>It is a command line program and would generally run on Linux or Unix.</li>
    <li>The program only reports the locations of trailing blanks. It is left to
        the user to remove them, if desired.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<span style="color: #000080; font-family: monospace;">     cktb.pl [-l] filename [filename...]</span>
where: <span style="color: #000080; font-family: monospace;"> -l </span>gives long output, 
instead of a summary.
<p>
For example, here is a file with some trailing white space and what the
report will show.
<pre><code>
Input (9 lines):

A line with no trailing blanks.|

A line with one trailing blank. |

A line with several trailing blanks   |

A line with a lot of trailing blanks                      |
