<h2>qscan.pl -- Scan for Excessively Long Quoted Strings (new version)</h2>
<hr style="height: 2px; width: 100%; margin-left:0px; margin-right:auto;">

Like 40scan.pl, this program scans a text file or program for double-quoted
and single-quoted strings.  If found, it reports those which are longer than
a defined number of characters.  The default is 40 characters, but qscan lets
you define other string lengths on the command line.

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This program is intended to be run from a Unix or Linux command line.</li>
    <li>Output is sent to STDOUT, so redirect it to a file to save the output.</li>
    <li>The program looks for double-quoted and single-quoted strings.</li>
    <li>The variable $checklen in the program sets the default length of strings to search for.</li>
    <li>Useful for making sure all your labels are within length limits, including SAS,
        SPSS, or in-house standards.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>
Assuming this program is executable, its commandline is:
<span style="font size: 115%;"><strong>qscan [-l#] [filename...]</strong></span>
<br>
where:<br> 
<ul>
    <li><i>-l#</i> is the number of characters withing quotes to search for</li>
    <li><i>filename</i> is the text file to be processed </li>
</ul>
