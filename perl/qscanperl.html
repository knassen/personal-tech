<h2>qscan.pl -- Scan for Excessively Long Quoted Strings (new version)</h2>
<hr style="height: 2px; width: 100%; margin-left:0px; margin-right:auto;">

Like <a href="scanperl.html"><strong>40scan.pl</strong></a>, this
program scans a text file or program for double-quoted strings, but
<strong>adds scanning for single-quoted strings</strong>.  If found, it
reports those which are longer than a defined number of characters. The
default is 40 characters, but qscan lets you define other string lengths
to search for on the command line. Originally written to ensure SAS and
SPSS variable labels were within the length limitations of the language.
qscan can be used for checking a variety of quoted string lengths. Get
all labels fixed without rerunning SAS repeatedly!

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This program is intended to be run from a Unix or Linux command line.</li>
    <li>Output is sent to STDOUT, so redirect it to a file to save the output.</li>
    <li>Very long lines will be truncated in the output.  This is to keep the output
        from getting too wide. The length will still be reported.
    <li>The program looks for double-quoted and single-quoted strings.</li>
    <li>The variable $checklen in the program sets the default length of strings to search for.</li>
    <li>Useful for making sure all your labels are within length limits, including SAS,
        SPSS limits, or for in-house standards.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>
Assuming this program is executable, its commandline is:
<span style="font size: 115%;"><strong>qscan [-l#] [filename...]</strong></span>
<br>
where:<br> 
<ul>
    <li><i>-l#</i> is the number of characters within quotes to search for</li>
    <li><i>filename</i> is the text file to be processed </li>
</ul>

<p>
An example run is shown below.
