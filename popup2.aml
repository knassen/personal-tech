Subject: An improved popup menu function

When checking the clipboard view function that was mailed the other day, I
found the line

    popup Buffer 'Viewing Clipboard: ' + ClipBoardName 71 17

where 71 may be a good choice for the width but maybe not.

Unfortunately the popup menu does not look nice with 'real' buffers when
there is no width specified. Recently, I wrote popup2 to overcome that
problem:

    // basically the same as popup menu, but
    // the length of the longest line in buffer determines the menu width
    function  popup2 (buffer title)
      l = (sizeof title) + 6
      pushcursor buffer
      gotopos 1 1 buffer
      repeat
        if (getlinelen '' buffer) > l then
          l = getlinelen '' buffer
        end
      until not (down 1 buffer)
      popcursor buffer
      popup buffer title l
    end

Simply place that function in EXT.AML in an 'object a' section, recompile
and

    popup2 Buffer 'Viewing Clipboard: ' + ClipBoardName

will popup an appropriate menu.

Regards,

Ingo

PS: BTW, you can popup the clipboard directly, it's a buffer.
