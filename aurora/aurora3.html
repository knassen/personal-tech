<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Aurora file manager window allows the user to select files for
several operations including editing, deletion, moving, copying, 
renaming, printing, and execution.  The file list may be sorted
several ways (e.g. by name, by extension, by size, or by date) and
special file types (hidden, system) may be set to list or not.  Directories
may be listed first if desired.  In version 3 of Aurora, a directory
tree display can be popped up and used to traverse a directory hierarchy.
<P>
The file manager may be set to pop up when starting the editor, when
exiting the editor, and also may be called up during an editing session
at any time.
