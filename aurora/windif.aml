Subject: Window difference macro

First of all happy New Year and best wishes.

A while ago I read a request to submit some useful macro's. Here is mine, 
unfortunately unfinished yet, but I could use some help too.

The objective is to transfer the last functionality reason to use Norton 
Editor once in a while: Search Window Difference, to a macro in Aurora.
Here's how I think it should work: first there is a check if there are only 
two windows open (this should be edit windows not file manager windows), 
next the windows are tiled horizontally and from the current cursor 
position in each window, a comparison is made character by character (this 
is very slow and should, of course, be done line by line), this loop is 
stopped once a difference is encountered.

I have run into a number of problems (without trying very hard):
- how to count only EDIT windows
- how to compare line by line (and skip empty line, specially when starting 
with one!)

Hoping to hear from you soon,
Nord
