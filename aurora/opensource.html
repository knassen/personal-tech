<p>Dear Jeff Wunderlich,
<p>Whereas the Aurora editor, published by nText Research, is no longer
obviously supported nor sold, and its development stopped at a rather
crucial juncture along the path to a full Windows32 GUI application,
yet there are still many devoted users, please make Aurora open source
software and let others continue development.

<p>I know this would not mean any additional income for you, but I doubt
that there has been much Aurora-generated income recently, anyway. You
would, however, gain the lasting admiration of Aurora users.

<p>Personally, I'd like to see Aurora32 out of its beta status as a
Win32 console application, with its registration nags removed (if we
can no longer register the program). This would entail some programming
effort, at least to remove registration code, and perhaps to fix any
bugs detected these past few years of beta testing.

<p>After that, there is the idea of moving Aurora to a full Windows
GUI application with all the flashy scrollbars, pull-down menus, and
buttons, yet with the core Aurora functionality and AML language
intact. Still further down the road, if the assembly language barrier
is not too great, Aurora could be ported to other systems, most
notably Unix. That particular world has many editors, but nothing as
flexible and easy to use as Aurora, IMO. I'm not sure of this latter
idea...Aurora is so fast it must depend on some critical assembly code
that might be difficult to port. But it is a possibility.

<p>As an initial sign of good faith to loyal Aurora users, please
release a registration code for Aurora32 that we can all use.

<p>Thank you for considering the open source software option, and
whatever you decide, thank you for creating a truly unique and wonderful
editor!

<p>Sincerely,

<p>--Kent Nassen (Registered Aurora user)
