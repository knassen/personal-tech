Subject: Re-posted message

Whoooaaa, what happened here? I originally posted this from work, but
when I got home the copy sent to my internet id was full of garbage. It
even came through as an attachment and not a message! I don't know if
everyone else got an email as screwed up as I did so I'm re-posting it.
Someone let me know if this one comes through okay...

{--------------------------------------------------------------}

Has anyone tried using version 3.0c under NT 4.0 Workstation? I just
"upgraded" my work PC to 4.0 Workstation (Andy, are you laughing?) and
now I can't get the copy from/to the Windows clipboard to work any more.
Anyone else try this yet?


Also, I'm including a small macro I wrote. This one emulates a feature
that my once-beloved-but-no-longer-used MultiEdit had. The bookmarks in
ME had a feature that allowed you to use a single character. I know;
Auroras default bookmarking scheme allows this as well, but you need to
hit <enter> too. Because of how many years I used ME I had become quite
accustomed to the single character scheme (although, I must admit that I
became more acclimated to Auroras way of doing it than I thought I would
have).

Anyway, the included macro closely duplicates the ME version of
bookmarks. It's an external macro that needs to be called with one of
two parameters; 'set' or 'get'. Example: runmacro2 'bookmark' '' 'set'
will popup a window in the "set bookmark" mode. In that same vein, using
runmacro2 'bookmark' '' 'get' will put the macro into the "get bookmark"
mode.

While the popup window is being displayed you merely type any single
letter, number or symbol to set/get a bookmark. Pressing either <enter>
or <space> will cause the 'booklist' macro to run, displaying what marks
you've already set.

Give it a whirl and let me know if you have any problems with it.
