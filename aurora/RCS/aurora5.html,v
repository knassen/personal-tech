<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>One good feature of the Aurora editor is its ability to open many
files at once.  It is possible to reduce a window to a small bar (sort
of like a roller shade on the screen), or to set the size up to a full
screen.  Cutting and pasting between windows is no problem due to a
common clipboard.  Aurora also does column marking (shown), line
marking and stream marking.  Searches (and replaces) may be limited to
a marked text block, which can be very effective in limiting replaces
without having to verify each replacement individually.  Aurora can use
regular expressions, which makes it useful when you spend part of your
time in a unix environment.
