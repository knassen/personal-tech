<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I prefer a rather barren screen a la WordPerfect. As a result, I
only use one status bar at the bottom of the screen, although there is
an optional bar at the top, too.  The pull down menus are activated by
hitting the ESC key, but are otherwise unseen. I generally operate with
my edit windows maximized, although Aurora allows you to minimize or
reduce their size so you can see more than one on the screen at a
time.  Even with windows maximized, the user may rotate through all
loaded files, forward or backward.

<P>Colors are customizable within the limitations of the DOS palette.
Editor configuration may be accomplished from within the editor using
a menu, as well as by editing the well-commented configuration files.
