<blockquote>
<p> This is a view of the Aurora file manager in a more ambitious role:
marking several files, then performing an operation such as copying,
deleting, or opening the files in the editor, on each of the highlighted
files.  The file manager also offers a "tree" view of the disk file layout,
from which files may be selected, if desired.  Or the tree may be used
to navigate to a particular working directory, then the file list can be used
to select files, as shown here.  Note the detachable menus: the "Command"
menu normally appears under its title on the menu bar, but I've pulled it
down to the bottom of the screen so it doesn't obscure what I've marked in
the file list.
