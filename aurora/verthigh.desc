  Subject: Two new macros

  - VERTHIGH
    This macro will produce a vertical highlight on the screen. I have    
    found this to be quite useful when trying to align columns of data.
    The highlight uses the current cursor position and goes from the    
    first line of the file to the last. It is fixed; e.g. it remains on the
    screen while you move around. To turn it off all you do is run the 
    macro a second time. Note that if you have a character or column
    mark on the screen when you run this macro funny things will happen
    to its color. Jeff is aware of this problem.
