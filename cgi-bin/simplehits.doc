About the simplest page access (hit) counter you can have, yet this one
can be called with either Server Side Includes (SSI) or if you cannot,
or don't want to, use SSI, by using the html <img src> tag instead.

If you call simplehits.pl with the <img src> method, then the counter
cannot print out the hit count, but it does record the hit in the hits
file. It is therefore a hidden counter, very useful if you don't want
the page user to know that there is a hit count on that page.

Why can't simplehits.pl print out when in <img src> mode? Because the
output to return as result of a call from <img src> - which is calling
for a graphic image - must be a binary graphic, and not text. So
simplehits.pl outputs a single transparent pixel called simplehits.gif
to the browser.

FILE TYPES

If you downloaded the shv101.zip package, just set your variables then
upload to your cgi-bin and other directories as appropriate.

If you downloaded the shv101.tar package, then you can either untar it
now and upload the files one by one, or you can place the tar package
in your server cgi-bin and in that directory issue the command

		tar xvfp shv101.tar

which will unpack the files into their correct places - except you will
need to put the graphics item and html items where they belong.


SETUP

SET VARIABLES

1       Set the path to Perl on your server. Probably #!/usr/bin/perl
or        #!/usr/local/bin/perl.

2       Select the type of counter you want by unhashing either "text"
or       "hidden" - but NOT BOTH

3       Set the path of  $hit_file to where you are going to put the
file       "simplehits.txt".       We suggest in a directory called
"data" under   your cgi-bin directory, but it can be anywhere you
like.

4       Set the path of $gif to the place where you store
"simplehits.gif".

5       In the two html test pages, "simplehits.shtml" and
"simplehits.html",   set the correct path to simplehits.pl.



UPLOAD

1       Upload simplehits.pl to your cgi-bin (scripts directory) and
CHMOD it   755

2       Upload simplehits.txt to your "data" directory and CHMOD it 666

3	Upload simplehits.gif to your graphics directory

4       Upload the two test pages "simplehits.shtml" and
"simplehits.html" to   your html directory.



TEST THE COUNTER

Open simplehits.shtml in your browser. With luck, it will show you a
smart red text counter reading 12346 - if it does then all is working
fine, as your simplehits.txt file started at 12345!. If you get a
message warning that "this directive was not correctly processed" or
similar, then it means there was an SSI problem. Either SSI is not
available to you (contact your server administrator and ask about it)
or your path to simplehits.pl is wrong. Notice that this page has the
extension ".shtml" and not "html". This is so that your server knows it
is a page that must be parsed for things like SSI.

Now open simplehits.html in your browser. You should get a clean page
with no counter shown. If you get the "broken image" symbol, it
probably means the path to simplehits.pl is wrong on this page.

If neither of these pages work, then call simplehits.pl directly from
your browser as http://www.your_domain.com/cgi-bin/simplehits.pl and
see what you get. If you chose a text counter, you should get a text
printout top left of screen, otherwise if it's a hidden counter,
nothing appears on-screen. But either way simplehits.pl should
execute.

If you get a Server Error message, check that simplehits.pl is CHMOD
755 and the file simplehits.txt CHMOD 666. And check that the paths to
the file and gif are correct.

We hope that this counter is useful to you - and if you want a smarter,
bigger one then try out the full-blown graphics counter "mcounter.pl"
from us. It is amazing!
