From the nText web site:
<a href="http://ntext.net/aurc33b1.exe">aurc33b1.exe</A>
for Win32 (95/NT) console mode (12-23-97, 673,703 bytes, self-extracting
zip file). <strong>This is a beta test version.</strong>
<p>
Also from the nText web site:
<!--a href="http://ntext.net/demoad.htm">Aurora DOS [bad link]</a>. The page
has links to the 386+ version of Aurora DOS, and the 8086 version.
NOTE: the 386 version of Aurora is required to install the 8086 version.
<p>
The Aurora editor is distributed as <strong>shareware</strong>.  It is
not public domain nor is it freeware.  See the documentation supplied
with the editor for details on the conditions of use for the shareware
version and for how to order a fully-licensed version of the
Aurora editor. 
<p>
According to nText, purchase "discounts are available for BBS sysops,
educational institutions, full-time students, US government agencies,
and approved user groups" as well as "quantity discounts and site
(multi-user) licensing."

It's a great deal!  Register!

<h3><strong id="mail">Subscribe to the Aurora Mail List</strong></h3>

This is a very low traffic list. Most of the responses deal with
questions about editor usage, particularly programming in the
Aurora macro language, as well as suggestions to the author for
future improvements to the editor. This is also where you will see
announcements for new versions of the editor, as well as comments from
the program's author (Jeff Wunderlich).
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> as of March 1998, the Aurora mail list has been
relocated. John Covici has generously offered to host the list at his
site (Thanks, John!). His site is not on the net 24 hours a day, so
the list response may be slower than it has been in the past, but it
is still quite acceptable. All previous Aurora list subscribers should
automatically have had their subscriptions moved to John's server.
<p>
This mail list uses the V-MailServer software, and you may (I
haven't tried it) be able to subscribe by sending an e-mail to 
<a href="mailto:listserv@ccs.covici.com">listserv@ccs.covici.com [bad link]</a> 
with the message "SUBSCRIBE aurora [Your real name]". Otherwise, send a
request to <!--a href="mailto:tarigan@sfu.ca">tarigan@sfu.ca</a--> 
<!--a href="mailto:covici@ccs.covici.com">John Covici [bad link]</a--> the Aurora mail 
list administrator.
<p>
Responses to the Aurora mail list itself (NOT subscription requests or 
unsubscribe requests: they should go to the listserver) should be sent to
<!--a href="mailto:aurora-editor@sfu.ca">aurora-editor@sfu.ca</A-->
<!--a href="mailto:aurora@ccs.covici.com">aurora@ccs.covici.com [bad link]</a-->.
<!--p>Also see <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Garden/7676/">Glen Tarigan's
web page [bad link]</A>.  Glen was our long-time list administrator until he found out
that his ISP wouldn't allow mail lists.  Thanks to Glen for all his efforts.

<h3><strong id="archive">Go to the Aurora Mail List Archive</strong></h3>

Steven La maintained an 
<!--a href="http://www.alphalink.com.au/~sla/aurora/axnarc.htm"--><strong>archive</strong></A>
of responses to the Aurora mail list from July 1996 to the present. The
mail list archive files listed at this site are currently downloadable
only, but well worth reading for tips on usage and macro updates (there
are some very talented Aurora macro programmers out there!). Recent mail
list discussion topics have included developing an Aurora macro for doing
floating point numeric calculations and reviews of Aurora in the press.

<dd>Here you will find the newest versions on the Aurora editor, including
the Win32 console mode version recently made available for testing.
This site allows downloads as well as on-line ordering and new contact
information.  It's still under construction so some of the links
may not work (but the information, download, and ordering pages seem
to be okay).</dd-->

<dt>An excellent Aurora Editor page! This page predates mine, is a lot
fancier, and there should be other useful information there. As noted
above, there is an archive of the Aurora mailing list here, as well as
more and possibly different macros and other Aurora information. Highly
recommended! (Link may respond slowly)</dt-->
