<H2>Apple II Sites and Information</H2>

In honor of my very first personal computer, an Apple ][e, here are
links to some of the many Apple II sites out there on the web. In my
current personal Apple ][ hardware collection are a ROM3 IIgs, a ROM1
IIgs, and Apple //c+, three Apple //e's, an Apple //c, a good ol' Apple
II+, and a cool-looking Darth Vader (black, Bell &amp; Howell) II, all of
which I still play around on once in a while. The other day I found my
<U>Assembly Lines: The Book</U> book...does that ever bring back the
memories...wonder what I did with my <U>Red Book</U>? Oh, here it is...
they sure don't build and document computers like this any more.
