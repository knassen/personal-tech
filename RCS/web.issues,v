Tue Jul  1 13:54:43 EDT 2025

Today I found this directory and checked everything into RCS, at least at the
top level directory.

I need to get base hrefs working everywhere.  Currently I'm in myperl.html
and while the main page loads, pages in the perl directory do not.  "Forbidden"

I might need to add a .htaccess file there.

It sort of works. Top level pages mostly load, but links below that do not.

The vim/index.htmt sort of works but the links need a new BASE HREF definition
for this area here.

I might be able to get my umich web pages working again.

I added the wrapit.html file, which cover the wrapit5.pl script.

There are a few more programs that need html files, too

I can get to the html files like this:
http://192.168.50.172/~knassen/umich/html/perl/wrapit.html

In wrapit.html, I need to move the line As an example... to after the
sample input because it says, would produce output like:  And that's not
the input data.

Also, 40scan.pl in this area is different from the 40scan.pl I use on
latte in ~/bin/40scan.  I need to see which one is newest and which one
runs the best.

Wed Jul  2 18:57:51 EDT 2025

I got the myvim/index.html file working more or less, graphics are
loading, pages are loading.  There a few links that still go the the
umich.edu server that need to fixed.

ksyntax.html needs to fixed to point to the local server.

I'm removing the hit counter code from all files.  

I got more of my vim pages working.  They need A LOT of editing. I don't
think I found any links that worked except maybe for vim.org.  So all that
needs to be checked for relocated sites, new sites, etc.

Wed Jul  2 23:38:50 EDT 2025

I went through all the html files in umich/html/ but not below that point.
And I changed the BGCOLOR to #fafafa and the BASE HREF to the local
server. So now all those links work and I can get back to the home page
(index.html).

splitit.pl and today.pl need html intro pages.

Thu Jul  3 09:41:06 EDT 2025

I coded up splitit.html based on wrapit.html.  I used the sample data from
the script and not from wrapit.html.  Descriptions were changed.

Now today.pl remains. I might want to use a different screenshot. Also
note that gnu call can highlight the date.  This script was for a cal
program that did not highlight the day. Is it worth putting up? Maybe only
for the parsing work, I suppose.

Thu Jul  3 21:36:42 EDT 2025

I spent some time today working on my Perl intro pages for the programs.
I did not do the today.pl one yet.  At this point, that is the only one
that needs and intro page.

I got figlet.html tuned up and working.

I got the sed.html page working. I had to edit unix.html for www-personal
links, and the sed.html for the same. Then it worked.

Fri Jul  4 09:07:20 EDT 2025

I got a lot more html files working to use the local web server. vi
files and aurora files are all done.

The perl/freqsh.html file is not loading from perl/freqperl.html file
(file not found).  Permissions are 644 on freqsh.html so that's not a
problem. The link in freqsh.html is "shell script"

I got it fixed. I had to update BASE HREF to point to umich/html/perl/ so
that these scripts got found (freqsh.html and printrec0.html)

vim/gr.vim is a list of graphics used in vim pages.  It should probably be
removed or called something else.  I don't see that it is used in any
html code.

Fri Jul  4 11:20:55 EDT 2025

I compared the Wayback Machine page for aurora.html and it has additional
content.  I've added it to aurora.html on the local system and am partially
through formatting it to match the Wayback Machine copy.

Most things are working on this html area now, but there is a lot of content
that needs to be removed, replaced, and re-written.

I also need to check the http-error lot in /var/log to make sure there are
not errors creeping into the code even though it displays correctly.

Fri Jul  4 16:00:29 EDT 2025

I had an issue with the vi/*.html files. Some worked and others didn't but
the code was correct (and the same).  I noticed the path to the html file
wasn't right.  I have another set of files for vi, vim, aurora, etc.
directly under ~public_html and those were getting picked over the ones
in ~public_html/umich/html/.  I changed a BASE HREF in the vi.html file
that referred to all the other vi files and then things started working.

I think I've finished the aurora.html file.  That involved creating
two new html files that get referred to on the main page.  I used the
WayBack machine to see what was in them.  One was aurora-log.html and
another was opensource.html. They were not complicated.

Lots of work done today. I worked on the vi and aurora areas and both
are working much better now. In fact, I think I'm mostly done getting
pages to load and in finding all the files.  However, now I need to fix
the broken links, either by finding the new location or by replacing the
link with a similar one that exists. vim, vi, and aurora are the three
biggest areas of the site and have the most html files to fix.

If I had a link checker, that might be useful for building a list of
broken links to fix.

And there's still a chance that comparisons to the Wayback Machine will
turn up some other missing files.

I need to find the figlet home site. http://www.figlet.org works.

I updated the figlet.html link for the Figlet main site.
