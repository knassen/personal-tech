<P><STRONG>NOTE: these pages are very old and Aurora is no longer
supported. The ntext web site is now (in 2025) questionable (has a
self-signed certificate.)</STRONG>

<HR>
<P><STRONG>Please note that the Aurora Text Editor is no longer sold and
no longer supported</STRONG> by its author/owner (NText). The shareware
version of the editor is still available at several shareware archive
sites and at this site (both the last DOS release for 8086 and 80386+
processors and the Win32 console mode beta version). You can still use
the program and below you will find a way to register Aurora32 (provided
by Aurora's creator), the Win32 command mode version of Aurora, which
still runs, even on XP and Vista. <STRONG>What you find here are my own personal
experiences and opinions as a registered user of this software. My
ability to help assumes I have the time and the necessary knowledge
(which I no longer do). --KN</STRONG>

<HR>
<STRONG>DosBox 0.72+ will run Aurora 3.0 (DOS) quite nicely on *nix
systems.</STRONG> See <A HREF="https://www.dosbox.com">the DosBox web
site</A> where you can find versions of DosBox for Windows, Mac OS-X,
several Linux distributions, FreeBSD, OS/2, and several other operating
systems. Also there are some tools and language add-ons there.

<P>A couple of things to note: one is that DosBox limits you to 63Mb of
memory, so this would constrain the size of file you can edit. Another
is that you are emulating DOS, so depending on the speed of your
computer, the performance may not be fantastic. But, it is one way to
enjoy Aurora in a *nix environment. (Aurora 32 will not run on a DOS
system, emulated or otherwise. For running Aurora 32 on *nix consider
running it in Wine.).  KN 05/17/2008

<HR>
<P><STRONG>Here's a tip someone sent for registering Aurora, which seems to work
    for any version of Aurora (old or new).</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>Either in the Macro pull-down menu pick "Macro Expression" or if
you have not changed the default key map to something else hit Alt-F12
to get the Macro Expression command line (or however you get to a
Macro Expression command line, which may be different depending on the
keyboard mapping scheme you've chosen).

<LI>Enter:
    <P style="margin-left: 40px">xE "Your Name"</P>
where Your Name is the name you want to use to register and hit return.
Note that your name must be in quotes. xE is a macro in the default Aurora library and not something you need to create, obtain, or modify.
<LI>Exit Aurora and start it back up. Your name should be registered. </LI>
</UL>
<P>This is quite interesting because it does not require any tools to implement other than Aurora itself.
KN 05/10/2008

<HR>
<P><STRONG>Jeff has kindly sent a way to run a registered version of Aurora32.</STRONG>
<P>Here is the pertinent information:

<P>"...the .bat file command I use to register is:
<BR>ac -reg "Jeff Wunderlich" "xujcwpkgzngqmqn" 1
<BR>Feel free to share it with anyone on the net."

<P>Also, see <A HREF="http://www.transmuter.org/index.html">http://www.transmuter.org/index.html</A> 
which is about a programming language called Trans that Jeff is developing for x86 Linux
and x86 Win32.

<P><STRONG>Thank you Jeff! --KN 09/07/06</STRONG>

<P>One note from a user who tried the above: if you can't get the
registration to work, try running the batch file in Win98 compatibility
mode. I used a batch file (.bat) with a name different from ac.bat and
the contents above, in the same directory as ac.exe. Running that batch
file under Win XP SP2 successfully registered Aurora32 for me, without
using compatibility mode. Running the "ac -reg" command from the command
line did not work for me. Your mileage may vary. KN, 10/07/07

<HR>
<P><STRONG>Should Aurora be Open Source?</STRONG>
<P><STRONG>NOTE: Jeff has decided he will not release Aurora code as open source,
    so this effort is no longer viable.</STRONG> --KN 02/24/03

<P><A HREF="aurora/opensource.html">A plea</A> to Jeff to release Aurora as open source software.

<P>There remains significant interest in the Aurora user community for
continuing the development of the Aurora editor. <DEL>If you would like to be
involved in petitioning the author for open-source status, working on
the development of Aurora if it ever does become open-source software,
or voice your support for this initiative, please let me know (use a
subject line beginning with "[AURORA]"). Send to knassen location umich

<H2><STRONG>The Aurora Text Editor</STRONG></H2>
The Aurora Text Editor is a fast, feature-packed, highly-programmable
shareware full-screen folding text editor for DOS &amp; Win32 console
mode. It offers an extensive macro programming language which can be
used to change the character of almost every aspect of the editor,
including customized pull-down menus and keyboard emulations of other
editors, as well as the ability to automate almost any editing task you
can imagine. Many macro examples are included with the editor.
<P>
Aurora takes advantage of available memory, including disk virtual
memory, to load and edit files as large as one gigabyte in the DOS
version and 4 gigs in the Win32 console mode version. Aurora can use
regular expressions to search and replace, which is a nice feature
if you hop back and forth between DOS and Unix. This editor also has
column-block operations, unlimited undo/redo, and syntax highlighting.
Aurora/DOS runs fine in a Windoze 3.1 or Win95 DOS window.
<P>
I have tried quite a few DOS and Windoze editors in the past ten years,
and occasionally still do, but I've never found an editor that is as
versatile, customizable, and fun to use as Aurora at such a reasonable
price. See the NText Systems <A HREF="aurora/features.html">feature
list</A> for further specifics on the DOS version. Check out the rest of
this Aurora site, too!  --Kent Nassen
