<dt>I run FreeBSD on my '486 at home, so of course, my web interests
tend to point in that direction.  FreeBSD is available for 
many systems, including i386, amd64, arm64, powerpc64, and riscv64. One of this
free operating system's strong points is TCP/IP networking. Many
application programs are available (freeware and commercial) as
ports and/or "packages" (precompiled binaries packed with or linked to
all the files needed to run the application--installing packages is as
simple as typing "pkg_add <em>package-name</em>").  A large team of individuals
continues to contribute actively to the development of FreeBSD. Includes Linux 
emulation.

<dd>NetBSD and OpenBSD are related free unix operating systems (based
on the 4.4BSD-lite distribution, as is FreeBSD), although it is fairly
safe to say now OpenBSD has found its own niche as a secure system.
The NetBSD group tries for maximum portability and stability across
platforms, while the OpenBSD group tries for maximum security while
retaining portability.  These operating systems also are of interest
since their software tends to port (mostly) effortlessly to FreeBSD (and
vice versa, one presumes).</dd>
