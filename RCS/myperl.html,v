<H2>Kent's Perl Stuff</H2>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
I generally use Perl for quick parsing and report-generation tasks,
usually of the one-time-only variety. The following scripts are tools
I've written and reused over the years--some by me, some shared among
coworkers. They're not polished software, but they work the way I want
them to. I'm sharing them 'as-is' with no guarantees. Feel free to copy,
use, or modify them, as long as you leave my name in the code. All were
developed on Unix systems (Solaris, FreeBSD), but they should run fine
on MS-DOS too. Perl version 5 is assumed unless otherwise noted.

I generally use Perl for quick parsing and report generating tasks that
are of a one-time-only nature. The following Perl programs are some
that have been frequently used by myself and others in a more general
context. They are probably not finished nor elegantly programmed, but
they work for me the way I want. I'm providing them 'as is.' No
guarantees, etc. They're my work, but you can copy, use, and alter them
as you will, as long as you give me credit in your program code.  All
were developed on Unix systems (Solaris, FreeBSD) but should be portable
to MS-DOG.  Perl version 5 is assumed unless noted.
