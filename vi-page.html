<H1>vi Information & Resources</H1>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%"> In addition to the <STRONG><A
HREF="aurora.html">Aurora Editor</A></STRONG> which I use under
DOS/Windoze, I use <STRONG>vi</STRONG> (pronounced "vee-eye") when
working on Unix systems. After trying pico and emacs, I settled on vi in
1990 as a good compromise between features, speed, and learning curve.
Since then I've found my choice to have been reasonable in terms of my
original criteria. In addition to this vi page, I also have a <A
HREF="vim/index.html"><STRONG>Vim page</STRONG></A> devoted to my
favorite vi editor.  <A HREF="mailto: knassen@NOWAYAMSPAYumich.edu (Kent

<P>
<H2><STRONG>A Short Description of vi</STRONG></H2>
vi is a full-screen text editor originally written to run under Unix,
but it has been cloned and imitated to run under MS-DOS, Windows,
OS/2, Macintosh OS, Unix, and several other operating systems as well. vi is
unusual in that it has <STRONG>two modes</STRONG>: an <STRONG>input
mode</STRONG> in which text may be inserted, appended, or overwritten,
and a <STRONG>command mode</STRONG> in which the user may issue searches
and/or replacements of text, move around the file being edited, delete
and copy text, perform file operations (read/write/save), and invoke
external Unix commands (such as sort, date, and fmt).
<P>
<STRONG>Up and Running Fast, But Powerful</STRONG><BR>
Basic editing tasks with vi (opening a file, moving around,
inserting text, deleting text, saving the file) can be learned in a few
minutes, but mastering this editor will take much longer since it is
relatively feature-rich and it can draw upon the full power of Unix,
including regular expressions, reading the output of unix commands,
and allowing unix commands to operate on the text being edited, as well
as macros/key mapping, and ex line editor commands.
<P>
<STRONG>Bizarre and Incomprehensible...</STRONG><BR> 
vi can seem rather bizarre, incomprehensible, and confusing to people
just learning it, especially if they are used to single-mode editors
such as the Aurora editor, emacs, the MS-DOS editor, Windows notepad/wordpad, 
xedit, Qedit/TSE, Multi-edit, Ultraedit, and the like. I know it took
me a while to get used to the <STRONG>h j k l</STRONG> cursor keys and switching
back and forth between command mode and input mode.  At some point,
however, if you have the right sort of sticktoitiveness eventually you
stop thinking so much about the commands you are typing.  At that
point, you're off to the races.
<P>
<STRONG>...or Fast and Efficient?</STRONG><BR>
vi can be a very fast and efficient editor once you get used to the
way it works. I like the idea that I can find vi on every Unix system
I've come across (and I use at least four different Unix operating
systems on three different platforms currently), that it is economical of
system resources, that it can do a lot of editing in very few keystrokes
(no mouse required), that it can edit huge files, and it can operate
quite handily over slow modem or internet connections (which seems to be
necessary more often than one would expect).
<P>
<STRONG>The vi Stuff: Get To It, Already!</STRONG><BR>
Below are some references and links of interest to vi users and the
curious.  I've included some screen shots of several popular vi clones,
too, as at least some vee-eyes now offer GUI (graphical) interfaces
with pull-down menus or button bars that might be of interest to a new
generation of potential vi users.

<H2>vi Books</H2>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
I own published copies of both of these books, and I find each of them excellent
in its own way. The Lamb book is what I started with...well, actually, I
started with the brief vi and ex command summaries in the 1990 printing
of <U>Unix in a Nutshell</U> by <A HREF="http://www.ora.com/">O'Reilly
& Associates</A> and puzzled my way along until I got Lamb's book. I
purchased the H-P book later, after I already knew enough to get through
a work day using vi without looking at a manual, but that book has still
been useful for its clear explanations.

VIM is <STRONG>V</STRONG>i-<STRONG>IM</STRONG>proved, a
<STRONG>free</STRONG> vi clone with many extensions and great features
such as multi-level undo, multiple windows and buffers, flexible insert
mode (use the arrow keys to move while in insert mode), visual mode
(execute commands on marked areas of text), block operators (operate
on rectangular blocks of text), and online help system. Vim 5.4 is
currently being tested, and looking good. The new 5.x versions offer bug
fixes and many improvements to the editor in general. In comparison to
Vim 4.x, the 5.x versions offer syntax highlighting for many languages,
a GUI interface (gvim), pull-down menus, an internal scripting language,
and the opportunity to include perl or python as an interpreter. Bram
Moolenaar (mool@oce.nl) is the principal author of VIM and coordinator
of VIM programming efforts. <A HREF="gif/vim50m.gif">[v5.0 SCREEN SHOT

nvi is the latest incarnation of vi from U.C. Berkeley (it's the vi that
ships with BSD 4.4). nvi is <STRONG>free</STRONG> and can use perl as an
extension language. Handles lines longer than 1024 characters now, which
I've found to be a tremendous improvement (many of the vi clones can
also handle really long lines, too). In addition, nvi supports multiple
buffers, unlimited undo, is 8 bit clean, and has command-line editing
and filename completion. Current version is 1.79. Nothing fancy about
the way nvi looks...plain ol' vi in a terminal window; I didn't expect
you'd need a screen shot of that. Also included at this site is the vi
FAQ.

Elvis <A HREF="gif/elvis21c3.gif">[V2.0 SCREEN SHOT 14K GIF]</A>is
a <STRONG>free</STRONG> vi clone written by Steve Kirkendall
(kirkenda@cs.pdx.edu) that offers multiple buffers, multiple windows,
and multiple display modes. In its most recent incarnation (beta test
v2.1g -- this is the first 2.1 beta, meaning all 2.1 features have been
added and the only changes will be bug fixes) it provides a very nice
X11 interface with a user-definable button bar, syntax highlighting,
pop-up dialog windows, and hex editing. Elvis 2.1 can view and print a
significant subset of HTML (its help system is written in HTML). This
editor has come a long way in the last year or so, so if you haven't
tried it recently, you should now. Version 2.0 is the most recent
release version (binaries are available for MS-DOS and Win32, source
code for Unix). Version 2.0 has most of the features of 2.1, although
the menubar has become more versatile in 2.1 (the 2.1 beta version is in
the "unreleased" directory).

vile stands for "vi like emacs." It is a <STRONG>free</STRONG>
vi-like editor with many emacs-like features. It has a very vi-like
"finger feel" according to its author, although it does not attempt
to be a complete vi clone. vile includes multi-file editing and
viewing, key rebinding, mouse support (in an xterm, or when built
as xvile), infinite undo, selection highlighting, rectangular
operations, "next error" cursor positioning after compilation, full
function-key and arrow-key support, filename &amp; command completion,
command/search string/filename history, auxiliary utilities for man
page and C program syntax highlighting, built-in macro language,
and an interface to Perl. vile ports to all UNIX platforms,
VMS, and DOS. xvile <A HREF="gif/xvile72.gif">[SCREEN SHOT 11K

complete mouse capabilities, and menus when Athena or Motif widget
libraries are available. vile and xvile were reviewed in the <A

WinVi <A HREF="gif/winvi263.jpg">[V2.63 on Win95 SCREEN SHOT 60K

to be compatible with the Windows Notepad editor. It offers such
features as fast startup (does not use DLLs), can edit files as large as
virtual memory, background may be set to a bitmap image, and selectable
(including True Type) fonts. This editor is still in the relatively
early stages of development and does lack true vi compatibility. For
example, macros &amp; abbreviations are not available currently. Also, only
one active file can be edited for each instance of WinVi running. Still,
this is another interesting adaptation of vi to the Windows environment
and one to watch as it improves. Versions are available for 16-bit and
32-bit Windows.

According to its authors: "Xvi <A HREF="gif/xvi219.gif">[SCREEN SHOT
8K GIF]</A>is a portable <STRONG>free</STRONG> multi-window version of
`vi'. In spite of its name, there is, as yet, no X-Windows-specific
version of it, but work is reputedly still in progress. Existing
versions use text windows separated by horizontal status lines
on character mode displays. The windows may represent different
files being edited, or different views on to the same file."

are also available from the vi archive. Xvi was actually my first vi
clone experience. It hooked me with its multiple windows and ability
to cut and paste between windows. Unfortunately, xvi had a number of
incompatibilities with "true" vi, so I moved on to other clones, and of
course, "true" vi. Anyway, xvi is still a very serviceable editor with some
handy features, including a small memory usage and multiple buffers.
