<h1>vi Information &amp; Resources</h1>
<hr style="width=100%; height 2px; border: none;">
In addition to the <strong><a href="aurora.html">Aurora Editor</A></strong> 
which I used to use under DOS/Windows, I use <strong>vi</strong> (pronounced
"vee-eye") when working on Unix systems. After trying pico and emacs, I
settled on vi in 1990 as a good compromise between features, speed, and
learning curve.  Since then I've found my choice to have been reasonable
in terms of my original criteria. In addition to this vi page, I also
have a <a href="vim/index.html"><strong>Vim page</strong></A> devoted to
my favorite vi editor. <a href="mailto:knassen@NOWAYAMSPAYchartermi.net">
--knassen@NOWAYAMSPAYchartermi.net</a>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>A Short Description of vi</strong></h2>
vi is a full-screen text editor originally written to run under Unix,
but it has been cloned and imitated to run under MS-DOS, Windows,
OS/2, Macintosh OS, Unix, and several other operating systems as well. vi is
unusual in that it has <strong>two modes</strong>: an <strong>input
mode</strong> in which text may be inserted, appended, or overwritten,
and a <strong>command mode</strong> in which the user may issue searches
and/or replacements of text, move around the file being edited, delete
and copy text, perform file operations (read/write/save), and invoke
external Unix commands (such as sort, date, and fmt).
<p>
<strong>Up and Running Fast, But Powerful</strong><br>
Basic editing tasks with vi (opening a file, moving around,
inserting text, deleting text, saving the file) can be learned in a few
minutes, but mastering this editor will take much longer since it is
relatively feature-rich and it can draw upon the full power of Unix,
including regular expressions, reading the output of unix commands,
and allowing unix commands to operate on the text being edited, as well
as macros/key mapping, and ex line editor commands.
<p>
<strong>Bizarre and Incomprehensible...</strong><br> 
vi can seem rather bizarre, incomprehensible, and confusing to people
just learning it, especially if they are used to single-mode editors
such as the Aurora editor, emacs, the MS-DOS editor, Windows notepad/wordpad, 
xedit, Qedit/TSE, Multi-edit, Ultraedit, and the like. I know it took
me a while to get used to the <strong>h j k l</strong> cursor keys and 
switching back and forth between command mode and input mode.  At some point,
however, if you have the right sort of sticktoitiveness eventually you
stop thinking so much about the commands you are typing.  At that
point, you're off to the races.
<p>
<strong>...or Fast and Efficient?</strong><br>
vi can be a very fast and efficient editor once you get used to the
way it works. I like the idea that I can find vi on every Unix system
I've come across (and I use at least four different Unix operating
systems on three different platforms currently), that it is economical of
system resources, that it can do a lot of editing in very few keystrokes
(no mouse required), that it can edit huge files, and it can operate
quite handily over slow modem or internet connections (which seems to be
necessary more often than one would expect).
<p>
<strong>The vi Stuff: Get To It, Already!</strong><br>
Below are some references and links of interest to vi users and the
curious.  I've included some screen shots of several popular vi clones,
too, as at least some vee-eyes now offer GUI (graphical) interfaces
with pull-down menus or button bars that might be of interest to a new
generation of potential vi users.

<h2>vi Books</h2>
<hr style="width=100%; height 2px; border: none;">
I own published copies of both of these books, and I find each of them excellent
in its own way. The Lamb book is what I started with...well, actually, I
started with the brief vi and ex command summaries in the 1990 printing
of <u>Unix in a Nutshell</u> by <a href="http://www.ora.com/">O'Reilly
&amp; Associates</a> and puzzled my way along until I got Lamb's book. I
purchased the H-P book later, after I already knew enough to get through
a work day using vi without looking at a manual, but that book has still
been useful for its clear explanations.

<p>
<span style="font size: 115%;">Hewlett-Packard Company (1990, <u>The Ultimate Guide to the vi
and ex Text Editors</u> (Redwood City, CA: Benjamin/Cummings Publishing
Co.).</span>

<dl>
        <dt>11 Chapters, plus an appendix on regular expressions. This book takes
a task-oriented approach to teaching the use of the vi and ex editors
and includes many examples.</dt>
</dl>

<p>
<span style="font size: 115%;">Lamb, Linda and Arnold Robbins (1998), <u>Learning the vi Editor</u> 6th ed.
(Sebastapol, CA: 
<a href="http://www.ora.com/">O'Reilly &amp; Associates</A>), 
348 pp.</span>

<dl>
<dt>Starts with a beginner's tutorial and works up to using ex,
global replacement, and advanced editing techniques. The 6th edition
now includes information on several vi-clones: nvi, elvis, vim, and
vile.</dt>
</dl>

<p>Also of interest for vi users is:

<p><span style="font size: 115%;">Friedl, Jeffrey E.F., <u>Mastering Regular
Expressions</u> (Sebastapol, CA:  O'Reilly &amp; Associates), 340+
pp.</span>

<dl>
<dt>This must be the most comprehensive tutorial and reference
about regular expressions published to-date. It includes in-depth
explanations of how regular expressions do their work and many
descriptions of the various unix tools that incorporate regular
expressions (such as vi).  This book really gets to the method behind
the madness of regular expressions and is an excellent reference.</dt>

VIM is <strong>V</strong>i-<strong>IM</strong>proved, a
<strong>free</strong> vi clone with many extensions and great features
such as multi-level undo, multiple windows and buffers, flexible insert
mode (use the arrow keys to move while in insert mode), visual mode
(execute commands on marked areas of text), block operators (operate
on rectangular blocks of text), and online help system. Vim 5.4 is
currently being tested, and looking good. The new 5.x versions offer bug
fixes and many improvements to the editor in general. In comparison to
Vim 4.x, the 5.x versions offer syntax highlighting for many languages,
a GUI interface (gvim), pull-down menus, an internal scripting language,
and the opportunity to include perl or python as an interpreter. Bram
Moolenaar (mool@oce.nl) is the principal author of VIM and coordinator

<strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/a/bostic.com/keithbostic/the-berkeley-vi-editor-home-page"><span style="font size: 115%;"> nvi Page</span></a></strong><br>
nvi is the latest incarnation of vi from U.C. Berkeley (it's the vi that
ships with BSD 4.4). nvi is <strong>free</strong> and can use perl as an
extension language. Handles lines longer than 1024 characters now, which
I've found to be a tremendous improvement (many of the vi clones can
also handle really long lines, too). In addition, nvi supports multiple
buffers, unlimited undo, is 8 bit clean, and has command-line editing
and filename completion. Current version is 1.79. Nothing fancy about
the way nvi looks...plain ol' vi in a terminal window; I didn't expect
you'd need a screen shot of that. Also included at this site is the vi
FAQ.

<strong><a href="https://elvis.the-little-red-haired-girl.org">
<span style="font size: 115%;">Elvis</span></a></strong><br>
Elvis <a href="gif/elvis21c3.gif">[V2.0 SCREEN SHOT 14K GIF]</a>is
a <strong>free</strong> vi clone written by Steve Kirkendall
(kirkenda@cs.pdx.edu) that offers multiple buffers, multiple windows,
and multiple display modes. In its most recent incarnation (beta test
v2.1g -- this is the first 2.1 beta, meaning all 2.1 features have been
added and the only changes will be bug fixes) it provides a very nice
X11 interface with a user-definable button bar, syntax highlighting,
pop-up dialog windows, and hex editing. Elvis 2.1 can view and print a
significant subset of HTML (its help system is written in HTML). This
editor has come a long way in the last year or so, so if you haven't
tried it recently, you should now. Version 2.0 is the most recent
release version (binaries are available for MS-DOS and Win32, source
code for Unix). Version 2.0 has most of the features of 2.1, although
the menubar has become more versatile in 2.1 (the 2.1 beta version is in
the "unreleased" directory).

<strong><a href="https://invisible-island.net/vile/">
<span style="font size: 115%;">Vile and XVile</span></a></strong><br>
vile stands for "vi like emacs." It is a <strong>free</strong>
vi-like editor with many emacs-like features. It has a very vi-like
"finger feel" according to its author, although it does not attempt
to be a complete vi clone. vile includes multi-file editing and
viewing, key rebinding, mouse support (in an xterm, or when built
as xvile), infinite undo, selection highlighting, rectangular
operations, "next error" cursor positioning after compilation, full
function-key and arrow-key support, filename &amp; command completion,
command/search string/filename history, auxiliary utilities for man
page and C program syntax highlighting, built-in macro language,
and an interface to Perl. vile ports to all UNIX platforms,
VMS, and DOS. xvile <a href="gif/xvile72.gif">[SCREEN SHOT 11K
GIF]</a> is the X11 version of vile, which adds scrollbars, more
complete mouse capabilities, and menus when Athena or Motif widget
libraries are available. vile and xvile were reviewed in the 
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/linux-info/lg/issue01to08/xvile_mar96.html">
March 1996 Linux Gazette.</a>  Vile is available for DOS, Win95/NT,
OS/2, and as source code for Unix and other operating systems.

<strong><a href="http://www.softwareonline.org/products.html">
<span style="font size: 115%;">Lemmy: A Unix vi for Windows 95 and NT</span></a></strong><br>
Lemmy <a href="gif/lemmy20.gif">[V2.0 SCREEN SHOT 15K GIF]</a>is a
rather interesting twist on the vi theme. It is a vi editor with
a windows interface for <a href="gif/lemmy3.gif">Win 95 &amp; NT [V3
SCREEN SHOT 10K GIF]</a> (and until recently, Win32s--couldn't
find that version last time I looked). Custom (fixed-pitch)
fonts, unlimited undo/redo, user-definable &amp; extendable syntax
highlighting, and the obligatory Windows-style pull down menus
are available, among other features. This is another vi clone
that has seen lots of improvement in the past year. The author
is <a href="http://www.drizzle.com/~james/">James Iuliano</a>, 
who keeps some lemmy information and tips at his
home page. Lemmy v3.0, however, is now being marketed by Software
Online, Ltd. and a single-user license, which removes nags and
affords free upgrades, costs $20 (other licenses available).

is now available (4/99).

<strong><a href="http://www.snafu.de/~ramo/WinViEn.htm">
<span style="font size: 115%;">>WinVi for Win95/NT and Win 3.1</span></a>
</strong><br>
WinVi <a href="gif/winvi263.jpg">[V2.63 on Win95 SCREEN SHOT 60K
JPG]</a> is a <strong>free</strong> Windows vi clone that was designed
to be compatible with the Windows Notepad editor. It offers such
features as fast startup (does not use DLLs), can edit files as large as
virtual memory, background may be set to a bitmap image, and selectable
(including True Type) fonts. This editor is still in the relatively
early stages of development and does lack true vi compatibility. For
example, macros &amp; abbreviations are not available currently. Also, only
one active file can be edited for each instance of WinVi running. Still,
this is another interesting adaptation of vi to the Windows environment
and one to watch as it improves. Versions are available for 16-bit and
32-bit Windows.

<p>
<strong><a href="http://home.att.net/~leeperd/ohvimain.html">
 <span style="font size: 115%;">Oak Hill Vi</span></a></strong><br>
Oak Hill vi is a shareware vi that is available in DOS and Win95/NT
32-bit console versions. It costs $35 to register, which gains the
user free upgrades, no more nags, &amp; user support via e-mail. This
program, in its Win32 console version, can edit very large files (DOS
version is limited to 250,000 characters). Other features include 8-bit
ASCII support, 43/50 line display, and on-line help.

<p>
<strong><a href="https://martinwguy.github.io/xvi/">
<span style="font size: 115%;">xvi v2.50</span></a></strong><br>
According to its authors: "Xvi <a href="gif/xvi219.gif">[SCREEN SHOT
8K GIF]</A>is a portable <strong>free</strong> multi-window version of
`vi'. In spite of its name, there is, as yet, no X-Windows-specific
version of it, but work is reputedly still in progress. Existing
versions use text windows separated by horizontal status lines
on character mode displays. The windows may represent different
files being edited, or different views on to the same file." 

<!--P>The <a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/text-processing/vi/programs">source 
code for xvi <strong>2.15</strong></a>, as well as binaries for MS-DOS,
are also available from the vi archive. Xvi was actually my first vi
clone experience. It hooked me with its multiple windows and ability
to cut and paste between windows. Unfortunately, xvi had a number of
incompatibilities with "true" vi, so I moved on to other clones, and of
course, "true" vi. Anyway, xvi is still a very serviceable editor with some
handy features, including a small memory usage and multiple buffers.-->

<strong><span style="font size: 115%;">comp.editors</span></strong><br>
comp.editors is a Usenet newsgroup devoted to text editors. Although
this newsgroup is for almost any kind of editor for any system, much
discussion of vi takes place here:  How do I do task Y in vi? Where can
I find...? What's wrong with my macro? and other topics, including the
perennial vi vs. emacs editor wars. Since usenet is mostly gone, this
one won't help much. It's here to note that comp.editors used to be a
place to talk about text editors.
