Subject: new paging functions



One thing I found a little annoying with the regular pageup/down in
aurora: when you get to the end of the file, sometimes only a few
lines of the last page of text are displayed at the top of the screen. 
Depending on where in the file you start page-downing, you can even
end up on the last page with only your ===end of text=== marker
displayed at the top of the screen.

I wanted page up and down to work like the top-of-file and
end-of-file keys.  With the end-of-file key (ctrl-pgdn), you always
get a full page of text when you get to the end of the file.  Also, if
you are on the first page and you page up once more, I wanted my
cursor to go to row 1.  So here's the code if you want to try it.  Add
these functions to your kbd.aml file, then replace pageup and pagedown
with pageup2 and pagedown2 in whatever objects you want.



  function  pagedown2
    pagedown
    if getviewbot == getlines then
      temprow = getrow
      row (getlines)
      adjustrow (getviewrows - 1)
      row (temprow)
    end
  end

  function  pageup2
    if? (getviewtop == 1) (row 1) pageup
  end



cheers,
