Subject: ClipBoard Viewing Macro

All;

Here's a macro that will allow you to view the contents of a
clipboard. I've often times copied something from a file and then
forgotten what it was. Instead of having to paste it someplace, and
then possibly having to delete it, I can now just display it in a
popup window. Note that you can view any clipboard you'd like, so long
as you know it's name (when the macro runs it takes the current
default clipboard and automatically inserts it's name into the
prompt).

I've only used this on my setup but I don't think there is anything
that should be config-specific. The code is commented enough so that
if you want to change something you should be able to.
