<h2>Kent's Python Programs</h2>

<hr style="height: 2px; width: 100%; margin-left:0px;
margin-right:auto;"> The following program is a command-line tool I've
converted from Perl. I'm sharing them 'as-is' with no guarantees.

<p>You may copy, use, or modify them, as long as you leave my name in   
the code. All were developed on Unix systems (Solaris, FreeBSD), but    
they should run on Windows and Mac OS, too, if you have Python available.
Python version 3 is assumed unless otherwise noted.             

<p>These programs were written to work on raw ASCII text files such as
LRECL (logical record length) data files where every line is the same
length, or on program text files, etc. They are intended to be run from
a command line. 

<p>The link below goes to a page that provides usage notes, example runs,
assumptions of the programs as well as links to view the program code,
and download the programs.

<dl>
<!--dt><strong><a href="perl/freqperl.html">freq: Compute frequency
counts</a></strong> for alphanumeric values in a column range of an
ASCII LRECL data set.  Answers the question "how many times do the
unique values in columns <i>x</i> through <i>y</i> occur in this
file?".</dt> <dd>&nbsp;</dd-->

<!--dt><strong><a href="perl/freq2perl.html">freq2: Frequency counts
w/percentages</a></strong> adds percentages &amp; cumulative percentages
to the frequency count program above. This output is more like what SPSS
frequencies produces.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd-->

<!--dt><strong><a href="perl/fixbperl.html">fixblock: Block a stream data
file</a></strong> to fixed line length by inserting newlines at a
user-specified logical record length. Makes all the lines the same length
from a stream of data.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd-->

<!--dt><strong><a href="perl/scanperl.html">40scan: Report length of double-quoted 
strings</a></strong> in a text file (such as SPSS or SAS variable labels).
Used to keep commands within limits for strings.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd-->

<!--dt><strong><a href="perl/qscanperl.html">qscan: Report length of double-quoted and
single-quoted strings</a></strong> in a text file (such as SPSS or SAS variable 
labels). New version. Generates a report of labels that are too long.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd-->

<!--dt><strong><a href="perl/todayperl.html">today: Print a calendar with today's date 
highlighted</a></strong> Assumes VT100-compatible terminal emulation and 
an available Unix 'cal' command. Mostly no longer needed since several
cal programs now have an option to highlight today's date.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd-->

<!--dt><strong><a href="perl/splitit.html">splitit: Convert multi-column SAS input or
SPSS data list statements</a></strong> into a single column. Useful for
reformatting SAS or SPSS input code another way.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd-->

<!--dt><strong><a href="perl/wrapit.html">wrapit5: Wrap a single column of SAS input or
 SPSS data list statements</a></strong> into multiple (5) columns. Fits more
statements on a line. splitit and wrapit5 do opposite formatting.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd-->

<dt><strong><a href="python/cklgpy.html">cklg.py: Check a SAS log file for
errors, warnings and other issues</a></strong> Output is in QuickFix
format for use with the Vim editor.</dt>
<dd>Using Vim's QuickFix functions, the output of this program supports
jumping to the line of the error or warning in your SAS
log. Or you can use the output directly to guide your debugging.
This is the Python version of cklg.pl.
<p>
There is more SAS-related content on <a href="/personal-tech/vim/sasfns.html"><strong> 
my Vim Functions for SAS Programming</strong></a> page. It includes 
a way to integrate cklg into gvim, as well as how to set gvim up for SAS
development.</dd>

<!--dt><strong><a href="perl/deblank.html">deblank: Turn multiple blank lines
into single blank lines.</a></strong> For example, if 3 blanks lines
are found in a file, this program will remove 2 of them and leave one
blank line.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd-->

<!--dt><strong><a href="perl/cktbperl.html">cktb: Check for trailing blanks
at the end of lines.</a></strong>It reports the number of blanks (spaces
or tabs) found on lines and the line with the longest string of blanks.
If your programming standards say no trailing blanks, this
program will tell you if you need to fix anything in your programs.</dt>

<dd>&nbsp;</dd-->

<!--dt><strong><a href="perl/detabperl.html">detab: Detab a file, two different
methods </a></strong>Detabbing in this context means replacing tabs with spaces. 
Choose between column-based alignment or literal replacement by a fixed number
of spaces. Each method produces distinct output which can be selected based
on formatting needs.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd-->
