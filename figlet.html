FIGlet is a computer program for making large letters out of ordinary ASCII 
text characters.  FIGlet lettering is used for web pages, email signatures,
text banners, etc.

This is the main site for all FIGlet activities, including standard and contributed fonts,

<!--dt><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~pjburton/"><strong>Paul Burton's FigWin Site [Broken Link]</strong></a><br>
FigWin is a GUI adaptation of FIGlet which has a number of
interesting and unique features compared to the regular command-line
FIGlet including vertical smushing and adjustable magnification of
fonts on screen.  FigWin can <strong>also be found</strong> at the FIGlet home site in the
<a href="ftp://ftp.internexus.net/pub/figlet/program/windows/"> 
/pub/figlet/program/windows [bad link]</a> directory.-->

<!-- Paul's a talented software interface designer. Check
out his <a href="gif/figwin.gif">screen shot</A>(12K gif) of Figwin.
Note that FigWin is a work in progress so function or screen layout may
change, although Paul says FigWin is now in late beta testing.
Hopefully soon Paul will also be releasing his suite of ASCII art
tools, including a Windows-interface ASCII font editor.

<dt><a href="ians.faq.html"><strong>FIGlet FAQ</strong></a><br>
This is an old abbreviated FAQ that was posted to the FIGlet mail list.
It tells how to subscribe and unsubscribe from the mail list, how to get
more fonts, as well as how to reach the main FIGlet site.</dt>
<dd><br></dd>

<dt><a href="https://asciiset.com/figletserver.php"><strong>Ascii Set FIGlet Server</strong></a>
    A web page that lets you pick a figlet font and generate text from it.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>

<!--dt><a href="http://www.inf.utfsm.cl/cgi-bin/figlet"><strong>Figlet Service</strong></A><BR>
Enter text in the form and have it returned in the FIGlet font of your choice.
Currently about 100 fonts to choose from.</DT>

<!-- dt><a href="http://www.sconnect.net/figlet/index.cgi"><strong>Web Figlet</strong></a><br>
Another web-based FIGlet text generator.  Select font, enter text, click
on "Do It" and then cut and paste the results.</DT>
<dd><br></dd -->

<dt><strong>alt.ascii-art</strong><br> 
The Usenet group rec.arts.ascii appears to have gone away when its
moderator retired, so alt.ascii-art is the remaining main ASCII art
news group.  Occasionally, people will post fonts there or announce new
FIGlet on-line services and software ports, but beware, without
moderation, there is a lot of garbage to sort through. Note: as of
2025 getting usenet is still possible, but not as easy as it was
25 years ago.  If you have access to Usenet from your ISP and they
get alt.ascii-art, take a look.</dt>

A <strong>very</strong> large ASCII art site. This site has not been updated since 1999, 
so is a static representation of the original site.</DT>
