FIGlet is a computer program for making large letters out of ordinary ASCII 
text characters

<dt><a href="figsamples.html"><strong>Kent's Conversions/Designs</strong></a><br>
These are my designs/conversions and conversions of other people's designs that
I've contributed to the FIGlet archives. I'm sort of on hiatus right now,
but I've got several partially-finished conversions and designs
waiting for completion.  Maybe someday...  I have a few of the fonts
I've contributed available to look at here in a sampler and as full
FIGlet font files to view or download.  Maybe I'll add more later.</dt>
<dd><br></dd>

<dt><a href="https://knassen.github.io/personal-tech/figfonts/other/otherfonts.html">
        <strong>Other FIGlet Fonts</strong></a><br>
Here is a relatively complete collection of the rest of the contributed
and default FIGfonts (actually this is <a href="http://www.cyberspace.org">grex's</a> 
figlet fonts directory, so some of these may not exactly match those in
the official FIGlet distribution and contributed fonts collections; I've
made a few corrections here and there, or added some characters at the
request of grex users in other words).</dt>

<dt><a href="http://www.figlet.org"><img src="/personal-tech/gif/figlet.gif" 
alt=""> <strong>FIGlet Home Page (Ian Chai)</strong></a><br>
Answers the questions "What is FIGlet?" "Why does FIGlet exist?" and "Where do I get FIGlet?"
This is the main site for all FIGlet activities, including standard and contributed fonts,
as well as binaries for several platforms.  Ian is the "I" in FIGlet.</dt>

<dt><a href="ftp://ftp.internexus.net/pub/figlet/"><STRONG>New Official FIGlet FTP site [broken link]</strong></a><br>
As of 12/9/97 this is the new Official FIGlet FTP site.  Thanks to the new
providers willing to host the well-known and highly celebrated utility
known as FIGlet!</dt>
<dd><br></dd>

<dt><a href="ftp://mickey.cs.uiuc.edu/minnie/pub/figlet/"><strong>FIGlet FTP
site [broken link]</strong></a><br> An alternative way of getting fonts, source, and
binaries for FIGlet. But not the preferred access method--it can be slow...
Use <a href="http://www.figlet.org">FIGlet
Home Page</a> instead, if you can.</dt>
<dd><br></dd>

<dt><strong>NOTE:</strong> ftp://ftp.nicoh.com/pub/figlet is no longer 
the FTP site for FIGlet! There is no longer anything to do with FIGlet 
at nicoh.com.</dt>

<dt><a href="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/unix/tools/figlet"><strong>ftp.funet.fi FIGlet Directory [broken link]</strong></a><br>
Appears to be a mirror of the main FIGlet FTP site. </dt>

<dt><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~pjburton/"><strong>Paul Burton's FigWin Site [Broken Link]</strong></a><br>
FigWin is a GUI adaptation of FIGlet which has a number of
interesting and unique features compared to the regular command-line
FIGlet including vertical smushing and adjustable magnification of
fonts on screen.  FigWin can <strong>also be found</strong> at the FIGlet home site in the
<a href="ftp://ftp.internexus.net/pub/figlet/program/windows/"> 
/pub/figlet/program/windows</a> directory.

<!-- Paul's a talented software interface designer. Check
out his <A HREF="gif/figwin.gif">screen shot</A>(12K gif) of Figwin.
Note that FigWin is a work in progress so function or screen layout may
change, although Paul says FigWin is now in late beta testing.
Hopefully soon Paul will also be releasing his suite of ASCII art
tools, including a Windows-interface ASCII font editor. -->

<dt><a href="ians.faq.html"><strong>FIGlet FAQ</strong></a><br>
This is an OLD abbreviated FAQ that was posted to the FIGlet mail list.
It tells how to subscribe and unsubscribe from the mail list, how to get
more fonts, as well as how to reach the main FIGlet site.</dt>

<dt><a href="http://www.reference.com/cgi-bin/pn/listarch?list=FIGLET-L@postoffice.cso.uiuc.edu"><STRONG>FIGlet Mail List Archive [broken link]</strong></a><br>

Enter text in the form and have it returned in the FIGlet font of your choice.
Currently about 100 fonts to choose from.</DT>

<!-- DT><A HREF="http://www.sconnect.net/figlet/index.cgi"><STRONG>Web Figlet</STRONG></A><BR>

<dt><strong>alt.ascii-art</strong><br> 
The Usenet group rec.arts.ascii appears to have gone away when its
moderator retired, so alt.ascii-art is the remaining main ASCII art
news group.  Occasionally, people will post fonts here or announce new
FIGlet on-line services and software ports, but beware, without
moderation, there is a lot of garbage to sort through. Note: as of
2025 getting usenet is still possible, but not as easy as it was
25 years ago.  If you have access to Usenet from your ISP and they
get alt.ascii-art, take a look (and hope it hasn't reduced to a trickle).</dt>

so is a static representation of the original site.</DT>
