text characters.  FIGlet lettering is used for web pages, email signatures,
text banners, etc.

<dd>Explore a large collection of default FIGfonts and contributed fonts from

<dt><a href="http://www.figlet.org"><img src="/personal-tech/gif/figlet.gif" 
       alt=""> <strong>FIGlet Home Page (Ian Chai)</strong></a><br></dt>
<dd>Answers the questions "What is FIGlet?" "Why does FIGlet exist?" and "Where do I get FIGlet?"
This is the main site for all FIGlet activities, including standard and contributed fonts,
as well as binaries for several platforms.  Ian is the "I" in FIGlet.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/figlet"><strong>An implementation of Figlet in JavaScript</strong></a></dt>
<dd>Has a number of effects, including kerning, horizontal and vertical layout.</dd>

<dt><a href="ians.faq.html"><strong>FIGlet FAQ</strong></a></dt>
<dd>This is an old abbreviated FAQ that was posted to the FIGlet mail list.
It tells how to subscribe and unsubscribe from the mail list, how to get
more fonts, as well as how to reach the main FIGlet site.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://asciiset.com/figletserver.php"><strong>Ascii Set FIGlet Server</strong></a></dt>
<dd>A web page that lets you pick a figlet font and generate text from it.</dd>

<dd>A short intro to using figlet, including figlet options, and font examples.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/cmatsuoka/figlet"><strong>Claudio's Figlet Github Tree</strong></a></dt>
<dd>Fonts, figlet source code with updates to version 2.2.4. Adds 
FIGLET_FONTDIR and fixes some code issues.</dd>

<dt><strong>alt.ascii-art</strong></dt> 
<dd>The Usenet group rec.arts.ascii appears to have gone away when its
moderator retired, so alt.ascii-art is the remaining main ASCII art
news group.  Occasionally, people will post fonts there or announce new
FIGlet on-line services and software ports, but beware, without
moderation, there is a lot of garbage to sort through. Note: as of
2025 getting usenet is still possible, but not as easy as it was
25 years ago.  If you have access to Usenet from your ISP and they
get alt.ascii-art, take a look.</dd>

    so is a static representation of the original site.</dd>
