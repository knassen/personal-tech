<dt>sed (Stream EDitor) is a noninteractive (batch) editor that can
quickly edit very large files. It is available for unix and for other
operating systems, such as DOS. sed can be used from the command line in
a one-liner mode to do quick searches &amp; replaces or deletes in a file.
It can also accept its commands from a file, so it is useful in a batch
mode. sed utilizes regular expressions, making it very powerful and
reasonably easy to learn if you are already using regular expressions
as a part of other Unix commands, such as grep, editors, or scripting
languages. sed often finds it way into Unix shell scripts. A trivial
example of a sed command might be:
</dt>
<dd><pre><code>sed '/dog/d' fyle</code></pre></dd>
<dt>
which would delete all lines in the input file ("fyle" above) which
contain "dog" (but not "Dog", "dOg", "d og" etc.) as a word or
word-part (e.g., hotdog, boondoggle, dog days, the lazy dog, etc.).
</dt>
</dl>
<p>
sed can be used for much more impressive and complicated tasks, of
course. The web sites listed here present much material on the use of
sed, including tutorials for the beginner, examples for the expert, and
many more sed resources on the Internet.
