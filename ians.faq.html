=================================================================
The latest version of FIGlet is 2.2.
=================================================================
RESOURCES
=================================================================
The "official" ftp site for Figlet is:
		<A HREF="ftp://ftp.internexus.net/pub/figlet/">ftp.internexus.net/pub/figlet</A>

The Figlet WWW page
        <A HREF="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/chai/figlet.html">http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/chai/figlet.html</A>
lets you easily download the software  by  pointing-and-clicking.
It  also  has  more  information  on  FIGlet, as well as links to
FIGlet services.
=================================================================
POSTING GUIDELINES
=================================================================
Remember not to post any discussions under SOFTWARE or FONTS.  In
fact,  you  should  never  post  under  SOFTWARE  --  it  is  for
"official" releases.  You can post any  new  nifty  software  you
write for figlet on the normal discussion, and if I decide to put
it in the "official" distribution, I'll post a notice to SOFTWARE
and make it available for ftp.

Also, please be careful when you followup a post from SOFTWARE or
FONTS  -- please delete the word "SOFTWARE:" or "FONTS:" from the
header so that you won't bother the folks who just want  SOFTWARE
or FONTS.
=================================================================
MANAGING YOUR SUBSCRIPTION
=================================================================
If you are going away for a while and your mailbox may overflow,
send <A HREF="mailto:LISTSERV@postoffice.cso.uiuc.edu">LISTSERV@postoffice.cso.uiuc.edu</A> the message
        set figlet-l nomail

To get off FIGLET-L,  send  LISTSERV@postoffice.cso.uiuc.edu  the
message
        unsubscribe figlet-l

To restrict your FIGLET-L mail to  only  software  announcements,
send <A HREF="mailto:LISTSERV@postoffice.cso.uiuc.edu">LISTSERV@postoffice.cso.uiuc.edu</A> the message
        set figlet-l topics=SOFTWARE

To  restrict  your  FIGLET-L  mail  to  only  software  and  font
announcements, send <A HREF="mailto:LISTSERV@postoffice.cso.uiuc.edu">LISTSERV@postoffice.cso.uiuc.edu</A> the message
        set figlet-l topics=SOFTWARE,FONTS

Please email me at chai@uiuc.edu if you have problems.  The  most
common problem is people trying to do this from a different email
address.    For    example,    if    you're    signed    up    as
fred@barney.cs.bedrock.edu  and  you tried to send these commands
from fred@dino.cs.bedrock.edu, it will fail and say  that  you're
not   on   the   list.   You'll   then   need   to   log   on  to
barney.cs.bedrock.edu and send the mail from there.
