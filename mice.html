<p>Okay, it has been suggested that I put in a little about myself (as
if all the rest of the links on this site don't leave a trail a mile
wide :-). As the picture above shows (assuming you can see it), I play
bass guitar (that's a <A HREF="http://www.carvinguitars.com/">Carvin</A>
above) and have since 1972. 

<p>My favorite amp is my black padded vinyl-covered Kustom B200 (100W RMS),
which is of course, much too loud for the neighbors. 
My current (and relatively long-standing)
musical interests are <A HREF="http://www.rockabilly.com">rockabilly</a>
(<a href="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Palms/1682/">The
Reverend Horton Heat</A> --that's psychobilly,
though isn't it?--the Stray Cats, Brian Setzer, 
<a href="http://bullwinkle.as.utexas.edu/scot/blasters.html">the
Blasters</a> [hey, these guys have their first vinyl album--1980--out
on CD now! "American Music" Get it!], ), and electric guitar blues
(<a href="http://www.thenighthawks.com/">The Nighthawks</A>, 
<a href="http://centerstage.net/chicago/music/whoswho/KinseyReport.html">The Kinsey 
Report</a>, Magic Dick &amp; J. Geils with BluesTime,
etc.). I also enjoy 60's, 70's and 80's rock, though nothing
at all disco-ish or rap-ish 'k? Think Lynyrd Skynyrd, the 
<a href="http://www.netspace.org/allmans/">Allman Brothers</a>, Ted Nugent,
Rush, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Blue Oyster Cult, Creedence Clearwater
Revival, John Fogerty, Stevie Ray Vaughn and you've probably got a
pretty good handle on what I like to listen to, eclectic as it may seem.
I'm not playing with any band currently, but I do play almost every day
for my own enjoyment.

<p>Just recently, I accepted employment with the 
<a href="http://www.parke-davis.com">Parke-Davis Division</a> of
Warner-Lambert Corporation in Ann Arbor as a programmer/analyst in
the Clinical Reporting Systems department. I'm very happy with this
move, related as it is to the duties of my previous job, but in a larger
department, with many new things to learn.

<p>My previous job was at the Inter-university Consortium for Political
and Social Research (<a href="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu">ICPSR</a>)
in Ann Arbor, MI, where I was a Senior Data Archive Specialist.
There I spent a lot of my time on a Unix server writing shell, AWK,
and Perl scripts, SPSS and <a href="http://www.sas.com">SAS</a>
programs, as well as the occasional C program. My main job there was
cleaning and documenting survey data collections. While at ICPSR, I
presented mini-seminars on the use of sed &amp; AWK and SAS &amp; 
<a href="http://www.spss.com">SPSS</A> for my co-workers.

<p>At home, I run the free unix operating system 
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</A> 2.2.5 on my old
486DX2-80. I run the <a href="http://www.xfree86.org">XFree86</a>
X-server with either the fvwm95 or fvwm2 window managers
(depending on mood). Currently, I'm goofing around with the 
<a href="http://www.gimp.org">gimp</a> graphics package and 
<a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a> 5.005. I use some version of the vi
editor every day (lately it's been vim and nvi, although elvis, vile,
and vanilla vi see regular duty also). I actually use or have tried
all of the vi clones I discuss and show on <a href="vi.html">my vi
page</a> and I usually edit my HTML code by hand using vi, hence the
<a href="http://www.darryl.com/vi.html">vi-powered</a> logo.

<p>As of July 2025 I run FreeBSD 14.3-Stable on a pair of Dell
Poweredge desktop servers (T105 and T130).

<P>One recent non-fiction book I've read was <u>Killing Custer</u> by
James Welch (with Paul Stekler) (New York: W.W. Norton, 1994). I'm also
recently finished <u>The Mystery of E Troop: Custer's Gray Horse Company
at the Little Bighorn</u> by Gregory Michno (Missoula, Montana: Mountain
Press, 1994). This indicates an interest in Custeriana, of course, and
a certain predilection to doing several things at once. On the fiction
side, I recently read Robert Ludlum's <u>The Matarese Countdown</u> and
<u>The Matarese Circle</u>. I also regularly read through the series
of Clive Cussler "Dirk Pitt" novels (and hope for something new ASAP--
such as <u>Clive Cussler and Dirk Pitt Revealed</u>, and the upcoming
<u>Atlantis Found</u>).

<p>I suppose at this point I could throw in my vita, but most people
find it a bit tedious (it's at around 6 pages now). I'm published
in at least one textbook on management and in several journals and
proceedings. My undergraduate degree was in journalism and industrial
management (double major) and a few years after that I earned my MBA.
I'm permanently ABD on a Ph.D. in marketing, which provided me with
a lot of methods classes and very little theory. I enjoy studying
statistics and statistical computing, as a result, which shouldn't
seem strange given all the stat and methodology courses I've had to
take at the graduate level. My latest collaboration "Representation
of Measurement Error in Marketing Variables: Review of Approaches and
Extension to Three-Facet Designs" by Richard P. Bagozzi, Youjae Yi, and
myself was recently published in the <u>Journal of Econometrics</u>
Special Issue on Marketing (89) 1999.

<p>In past lives, I've earned a ham radio license back in the days when
you needed to know Morse code to pass (novice, KA0QEQ probably long
since expired/retired), accumulated over 80 hours flying single engine
airplanes including three solo X-countries, water skied all summer,
spent my autumns and winters hunting squirrels, pheasants, ducks, and
geese.  I've also enjoyed fishing year 'round for many years although
I haven't found Michigan very conducive for that sport in spite of its
reputation (too much pollution for me to tolerate; I really hate those
"don't eat more than X fish a day" signs). In previous employment, I've
run Heidelberg K-line offset and letter presses, done darkroom work,
bindery work, been a bookkeeper for a business, and a manager for a
commercial print shop. I'm occasionally known to brew my own beer; I
prefer stouts. If I could brew Guinness, that'd be perfect.

<p>On the <a href="http://www.cyberspace.org/">Grex</a> public-access
computer conferencing system, I'm the <a href="figlet.html">FIGlet</a>
font maintainer and the fairwitness of the Life 101/Consumer computer
conference, which tends to be the catch-all conference for anything to
do with purchasing and using products, as well as finding sources for
goods &amp; services. 
<p>
Note: cyberspace.org and it's grex.org server were deleted April 15,
2023 and that site is no longer on the internet or in operation as
an organization.
<p>
On the <a href="http://www.arbornet.org/">M-Net</a> 
public-access conferencing system, I'm one of the fairwitnesses of the 
Unix conference.

<p>Currently, I share an apartment with my wife, Suzi, and two cats,
Cricket and George. I'm allergic to the latter two, so I'm not a big
fan of cats, although Cricket seems to be a fan of me. My wife works
for the University of Michigan as a network operations consultant in
the University-wide network operations center. My stepson, Jonathan
is finished duking it out with the Juvenile Court system, and claims
to work for at a local video games establishment. He's now 18 (yay!)
and has decided that high school is a waste of time. We could call him
foolish, but he wouldn't listen. My stepdaughter, Dorothy, and her
husband Chris, just had their second child, a girl named Elizabeth
Danielle.  Forrest is their other good kid.

<p>So there you have a bit of the past, a lot of the present and a
little of the future for Kent Nassen. This is more than anyone will
read, I'm sure, and certainly more than anyone will care about.

<p>--Kent
