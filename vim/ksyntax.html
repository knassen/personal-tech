<H2>Kent's Vim Syntax Files<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%"></H2>

Here are three vim syntax highlighting files I've cobbled together for
use where I work.  I'm sure they are not finished yet, but then all such
setups lend themselves to a bit of tweaking now and then...

<P> Note that you must use at least the 5.0m release of Vim to get
these to work without adjusting the syntax (I did have them running
under earlier alpha versions of Vim 5.0, but the syntax highlighting
features for 5.0 have changed slightly as the alpha testing has
progressed). Anyway, these may serve as a basis for someone else to
make improvements, so here you go.  Let me know if you have a way to
improve these; shouldn't be difficult :-).

<STRONG><A HREF="sas.vim"><FONT SIZE="+1">SAS Syntax File</FONT></A></STRONG><BR>
This syntax file covers the BASE and STAT modules of the SAS System.
There are a number of overlaps between keywords of different groups yet
to be resolved and a lot of SAS symbols aren't highlighted
yet.  Anyway, it might give you some ideas for how you could alter it
for how you use SAS.  See <A HREF="http://www.sas.com">http://www.sas.com</A> for
more information on the SAS System.

<P>
<STRONG><A HREF="sps.vim"><FONT SIZE="+1">SPSS Syntax File</FONT></A></STRONG><BR>
This is for highlighting most of the SPSS statistical package's
commands.  Again, there is some overlap between keywords of different
groups that will need to be resolved, and there're way too many
subcommands all in one group, but it's a start.  See <A HREF="http://www.spss.com">http://www.spss.com</A> for more about SPSS.

<P>
<STRONG><A HREF="cbg.vim"><FONT SIZE="+1">Cbentr/Cbgen Syntax File</FONT></A></STRONG><BR> 
This is an example of how I use Vim 5.0 to help me in the editing I
have to do at work (and probably something that no one else would
use). cbg.vim is for a little-known text markup language called cbentr
(it's used for formatting codebooks for data collections, and is
derived from the OSIRIS era of codebook and data processing, and is probably
specific to <A HREF="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu">ICPSR</A>). I've been
using a slightly newer interpreter for cbentr commands, called 'cbgen'
hence this syntax file is called cbg.vim.  If you want more information
about this, let me know.

<P>cbentr/cbgen uses a small set of commands that begin in the first
column. All commands begin with a slash (/). Examples include /Q for
question text, /V for variable number, and /C for the variable's
codes, so when you see those in this syntax file, that's what's
going on. 

<P>Lately, I've been editing a lot of codebooks for the 
<A HREF="http://www.za.uni-koeln.de/data/en/eurobarometer/index.htm">Eurobarometer</A> 
survey series, so many of the keywords in this
file relate specifically to that (ESOMAR, NUTS, etc.) and not to
cbentr/cbgen. Hey, why not include some of those special project terms?
They're easy to change/remove when you move on to something else.

<P>
<HR SIZE=3>
<P>Note that Vim's highlighting can outline the errors in a file as well
as the usual syntax constructions. In the cbentr/cbgen example, I've set
"???" as an error to be highlighted in red. This lets me insert three
question marks for things that are partially done or unverified and
they'll be pointed out brilliantly the next time I open the file.

<P>I've got a few more of these for more obscure specific uses at work,
such as helping me filling out standardized forms correctly, but I'm not
sure they're very will done (as if the above are--ha!). I may put them
up later if I get a few of the bugs ironed out.

<P>My operating environments:<BR>
Work: Solaris 2.5 on Sun SparcServer, 512MB RAM, never too much hard
disk space, Sun OpenWindows with Athena and Motif widgets. Also Windoze
3.1 running Exceed v4, and DOS 6.2. Home: FreeBSD 2.2.1 on a 486DX2-80
system with 40MB RAM and 2 gig hard disk, running XFree86 3.2 with Xaw3d.
