Vim is <STRONG>V</STRONG>i-<STRONG>IM</STRONG>proved, a free vi text
editor clone with many extensions and great features such as multi-level
undo, multiple windows and buffers, flexible insert mode (use the arrow
keys to move while in insert mode), visual mode (execute commands on
marked areas of text), block operators (operate on rectangular blocks of
text), and online help system. I've come a long way down the vi trail
since 1990...vi, xvi, elvis, vile, xvile, nvi, and now, Vim. Consider this
page a paltry tribute to Vim: a most useful, efficient, and enjoyable
free editor of the vi type. Here is <A HREF="../gif/vim50t2.gif"><STRONG>a peek
(screen shot 55K GIF)</STRONG>.</A> at how Vim 5.0t compiled with
Lesstif 0.82 looks on my FreeBSD system running the XFree86 XWindow
server and fvwm95. 

<P>Vim is under active and ongoing development. Vim 5.3 has 
recently been released. This new version, compared to vim 4.6,
offers color syntax highlighting for many languages, a GUI interface
(gvim), pull-down menus, functions, and the opportunity to include perl 
and/or python and/or tcl/tk as an interpreter. You can find three 
examples here of how I've been using Vim 5.x's color syntax highlighting 
features on my <A HREF="ksyntax.html"><STRONG>Vim syntax file page</STRONG></A>.

<P>If you don't know what "vi" is, my more generic
<A HREF="http://192.168.50.172/~knassen/umich/html/vi.html"><STRONG>vi
Information &amp; Resources </STRONG></A> page will give a brief 
introduction and some links to further sources of information.  

<P>Comments and suggestions about this Vim page are welcome.

This site is the main repository for Vim-related information. <STRONG>Definitely
look here!</STRONG> (Bram Moolenaar (mool@@oce.nl) is the author of VIM.)

<P><STRONG><A HREF="http://www.vim.org/deve.html"><FONT SIZE="+1">Vim Development Page</FONT><BR>(http://www.vim.org/deve.html)</A></STRONG><BR>
A page with information about the current development status of Vim. Vim
5.3 is the latest release version. Vim 5.4 is currently in development.
Also included at this site is information about the development of vim
for Windows, and where you can get development releases of vim. Note
that such releases are for testing only. If you just want to see what
vim 5.x looks like, see this example <A HREF="../gif/vim50m.gif">screen
shot</A> of vim 5.0m.

Laurent is the maintainer of the Vim FAQ, which should answer a number
of common VIM questions. This site also features Vim macros and Vim
icons!

</STRONG><BR>
Approximately two dozen macros for Vim in the categories of Toys &
Entertainment (for example, a macro for creating text stereograms, and
the Tower of Hanoi macro), Documents & Languages (including macros for
C, HTML, and LaTex editing), and Miscellaneous (such as a file manager 
macro).

Also there are examples of "Hello, world" in vi, the Towers of Hanoi
puzzle solver vi macros, and a couple different sets of HTML macros
for vi. This site leans heavily toward VIM, but has a lot of "true" vi
content as well.
