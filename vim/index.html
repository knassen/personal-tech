width: 100%; margin-left:0px; margin-right:auto;"> Vim is
<strong>V</strong>i-<strong>IM</strong>proved, a free vi-compatible text
editor with many extensions and great features such as multi-level undo,
multiple windows, tabs, and buffers, flexible insert mode (use the arrow
keys to move while in insert mode), visual mode (execute commands on
marked areas of text), block operators (operate on rectangular blocks
of text), and online help system. Vim 9 added the vim9script language
(legacy vim script is still available), which has generic functions (via
:def) now which are compiled and very fast, functions and variables are
script local by default. Wayland support has been added and is being
improved. Color schemes have been updated, command line completions
occur in a popup menu, xxd has been updated.

Vim's long-time developer, Bram Moolenaar, passed away 3 August 2023
after more than 30 years of programming vim.  The Vim project has been
continued by a group of long-time trusted submitters.
<p>
The Vim 9.1 release was dedicated to Bram.

I've come a long way down the vi trail since 1990...vi, xvi, elvis,
vile, xvile, nvi, and now, Vim. Consider this page a paltry tribute
to Vim: a most useful, efficient, and enjoyable free editor of the
vi type. Here is <a href="../gif/vim_91.png"><strong>a peek (screen
shot)</strong>.</A> at how Vim 9.1 looks on my FreeBSD 14.3-STABLE
system with the vim zenburn colorscheme.
<p>
When I was working, I used gvim most of the time and used a few tricks
to make Vim into a good SAS development environment.  I collected
these tips in a page of <a href="sasfns.html"><strong>functions for Vim
when programming in SAS</strong></a>
<p>
If you don't know what "vi" is, my more generic
<a href="/personal-tech/vi/vi.html"><strong>vi
Information &amp; Resources </strong></a> page will give a brief 
introduction and some links to further sources of information.  
<p>
Comments and suggestions about this Vim page are welcome.

A page with information about the current development status of Vim. Vim
9.1 is the latest release version. Vim 5.4 is currently in development.
Also included at this site is information about the development of vim
for Windows, and where you can get development releases of vim. Note
that such releases are for testing only. If you just want to see what

Approximately two dozen macros for Vim in the categories of Toys &amp;

the Tower of Hanoi macro), Documents &amp; Languages (including macros for
C, HTML, and LaTex editing), and Miscellaneous (such as a file manager

Also there are examples of "Hello, world" in vi, the Towers of Hanoi
puzzle solver vi macros, and a couple different sets of HTML macros
for vi. This site leans heavily toward VIM, but has a lot of "true" vi
content as well.
