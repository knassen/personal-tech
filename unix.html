    <h2>Unix-Related Sites</h2>
<hr style="height: 2px; width: 100%; margin-left:0px; margin-right:auto;">

I run Raspberry Pi OS on several Raspberry Pi computers and Debian on a
BeagleBone Black. I'm a fan of Debian, and have Ubuntu and Linux Mint
running in several VMs.  They allow me to test various systems. There are
too many Linux distributions for this page. 
<p>
This is a little bit of everything and nothing too intense.  If you are
interested in Unix, here are some sites related to unix systems including
awk, sed, vi, vim, and several Unix OS distributions to get you started.
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://www.freebsd.org"><img src="/personal-tech/gif/devil-tiny.gif" alt="">
        <strong>FreeBSD Page</strong></a></dt>
<dd>I run FreeBSD (currently version 14.3-stable) on my Dell Poweredge
servers at home.  FreeBSD is available for many systems, including
i386 (support ends with version 15), amd64, arm64, powerpc64, and
riscv64. One of this free operating system's strong points is TCP/IP
networking. Many application programs are available (freeware and
commercial) as ports and/or "packages" (precompiled binaries packed with
or linked to all the files needed to run the application--installing
packages is as simple as typing "pkg install <em>package-name</em>"). A
large team of individuals continues to contribute actively to the
development of FreeBSD. Includes Linux emulation (currently Rocky Linux).</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.netbsd.org"><strong>NetBSD
Page</strong></a>&nbsp; and&nbsp; 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org"><strong>OpenBSD Page</strong></a></dt>
<dd>NetBSD and OpenBSD are related free unix operating systems (based
on the 4.4BSD-lite distribution, as is FreeBSD), although it is fairly
safe to say now OpenBSD has found its own niche as a secure system.
The NetBSD group tries for maximum portability and stability across
platforms, while the OpenBSD group tries for maximum security while
retaining portability.  These operating systems also are of interest
since their software tends to port (mostly) effortlessly to FreeBSD (and
vice versa).</dd>

<dt><a href="https://www.dragonflybsd.org"><strong>DragonFly BSD</strong></a></dt>
<dd>Another BSD-derived system is DragonFly BSD. Its most-prominent feature
is the HAMMER2 high-performance file systems, offering instant snapshots,
compression, and de-duplication. The DragonFly kernel has been worked on
to make it less prone to deadlocks, capable of using all cpu, memory, and
I/O resources.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.ugu.com/"><strong>Unix Guru Universe Unix SysAdmin Page</strong></a></dt>
<dd>The Official Home Page for Unix System Administrators.  The site is
broken down into the following areas:  (Unix) Flavors, System Administration,
Networking, Security, Software (62 categories), Help,
Conferences/Shows/Events, Vendors, Careers, and Internet. Too much to
describe in a short space.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/7/resources-sysadmin">
<strong>10 Resources every sysadmin should know</strong></a></dt>
<dd>10 resources like crontab guru, samba, hex keys and screwdrivers, 
    and telnet.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://www.admin.com"><strong>Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook</strong></a>
    <dd>Evi Nemeth, et al, 5th edition, information.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://reference.perl.com/"><strong>Perl Reference Page</strong></a></dt>
<dd>A good starting point for learning about Perl, including some system
    administration tools written in perl.</dd>

<dt><a href="sed.html"><strong>sed Sites</strong></a></dt>
<dd>Several links to seders sites, and other information about the sed editor.</dd>

<dt><a href="awk.html"><strong>awk Sites</strong></a></dt>
<dd>Several links to sites with awk information, including for GNU awk.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://knassen.github.io/personal-tech/myperl.html"><strong>Perl Scripts and Links</strong></a></dt>
<dd>Several Perl programs and scripts written for checking data and programs, plus
    some general Perl links to sites with information for beginners and experienced
    programmers.</dd>

<dt><a href="/personal-tech/vi/vi.html"><strong>My vi pages</strong></a></dt>
<dd>General overview of my vi experiences with several vi editors, information
    sources for vi, screenshots of vi editors, links to books about vi and vim,
    and links to vi-related web sites.</dd>

<dt><a href="/personal-tech/vim/index.html"><strong>My Vim Page</strong></a></dt>
<dd>Vim information, links to vim-related sites, my usage of vim for programming,
    including functions for SAS programming in vim.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://www.debian.org"><strong>Debian</strong></a></dt>
<dd>Debian, a Linux-based operating system, and is used by many other
    Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu and Knoppix are based on Debian).
    Debian supports many CPU architectures. Many software packages are 
    available. A long-term support version is available.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://ubuntu.com/desktop"><strong>Ubuntu Desktop</strong></a></dt>
<dd>Ubuntu is based on Debian and it prioritizes user privacy and system
    integrity. Certified for the Raspberry Pi. Can be used in Windows Subsystem
    for Linux. Can be installed in several "flavors" such as Kubuntu and
    Ubuntu Budgie. </dd>
