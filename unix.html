<dt><a href="http://www.freebsd.org"><img src="/personal-tech/gif/devil-tiny.gif" alt="">
<strong>FreeBSD Page</strong></a>
<!--&nbsp;---&nbsp;<a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/"><strong>FTP to freebsd.org</strong></a--></dt>
<dt>I run FreeBSD on my '486 at home, so of course, my web interests
tend to point in that direction.  FreeBSD is available for 
many systems, including i386, amd64, arm64, powerpc64, and riscv64. One of this
free operating system's strong points is TCP/IP networking. Many
application programs are available (freeware and commercial) as
ports and/or "packages" (precompiled binaries packed with or linked to
all the files needed to run the application--installing packages is as
simple as typing "pkg_add <em>package-name</em>").  A large team of individuals
continues to contribute actively to the development of FreeBSD. Includes Linux 
emulation.

<dt><a href="http://www.netbsd.org"><strong>NetBSD
Page</strong></a>&nbsp; and&nbsp; 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org"><strong>OpenBSD Page</strong></a></dt>
<dd>NetBSD and OpenBSD are related free unix operating systems (based
on the 4.4BSD-lite distribution, as is FreeBSD), although it is fairly
safe to say now OpenBSD has found its own niche as a secure system.
The NetBSD group tries for maximum portability and stability across
platforms, while the OpenBSD group tries for maximum security while
retaining portability.  These operating systems also are of interest
since their software tends to port (mostly) effortlessly to FreeBSD (and
vice versa, one presumes).</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.ugu.com/"><strong>Unix Guru Universe Unix SysAdmin Page</strong></a></dt>
<dd>The Official Home Page for Unix System Administrators.  The site is
broken down into the following areas:  (Unix) Flavors, System Administration,
Networking, Security, Software (62 categories), Help,
Conferences/Shows/Events, Vendors, Careers, and Internet. Too much to
describe in a short space.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/reuse/">
<strong>Practical Reusable UNIX Software [bad link]</strong></a></dt>
<dt>ksh93 and other reusable software tools. Downloading programs
requires assenting to a license agreement.</dt>

<dt><a href="http://www.stokely.com/unix.sysadm.resources/index.html">
<strong>Unix System Administrator's Resources [bad link]</strong></a></dt>
<dd>Many information sources and links to same: FAQs, patches, tutorials, and
    more.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www2.shore.net/~jblaine/vault/"><strong>Jeff's Unix Vault [bad link]</strong></a></dt>
<dd>According to the author this site is "an attempt at a complete compendium of 
UNIX and strongly UNIX-related material." Stuff for many flavors of unix, 
including shells, security-related files, links to other Unix materials 
(organizations, FAQs, etc.), windowing systems, and scripting information.
Once again, too much to adequately describe here.</dd>

<dt><a href="ftp://oak.oakland.edu/pub/unix-c/"><strong>oak.oakland.edu/pub/unix-c [bad link]</strong></a></dt>
<dd>A bit on the old side as far as the ages of the files, but often useful for the
source code to any number of handy utilities and replacement programs for those
systems lacking them.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://reference.perl.com/"><strong>Perl Reference Page</strong></a></dt>
<dd>A good starting point for learning about Perl, including some system
    administration tools written in perl.</dd>

<dt><a href="sed.html"><strong>sed Sites</strong></a></dt>
<dd>Several links to seders sites, and other information about the sed editor.</dd>

<dt><a href="awk.html"><strong>awk Sites</strong></a></dt>
<dd>Several links to sites with awk information, including for GNU awk.</dd>
