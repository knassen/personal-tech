<dd>I run FreeBSD (currently version 14.3-stable) on my Dell Poweredge
servers at home.  FreeBSD is available for many systems, including i386
(ends with version 15), amd64, arm64, powerpc64, and riscv64. One of
this free operating system's strong points is TCP/IP networking. Many
application programs are available (freeware and commercial) as ports
and/or "packages" (precompiled binaries packed with or linked to all the
files needed to run the application--installing packages is as simple
as typing "pkg_add <em>package-name</em>"). A large team of individuals
continues to contribute actively to the development of FreeBSD. Includes
Linux emulation.</dd>

Page</strong></a>&nbsp; and&nbsp; 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org"><strong>OpenBSD Page</strong></a></dt>
<dd>NetBSD and OpenBSD are related free unix operating systems (based
on the 4.4BSD-lite distribution, as is FreeBSD), although it is fairly
safe to say now OpenBSD has found its own niche as a secure system.
The NetBSD group tries for maximum portability and stability across
platforms, while the OpenBSD group tries for maximum security while
retaining portability.  These operating systems also are of interest
since their software tends to port (mostly) effortlessly to FreeBSD (and
vice versa, one presumes).</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.ugu.com/"><strong>Unix Guru Universe Unix SysAdmin Page</strong></a></dt>
<dd>The Official Home Page for Unix System Administrators.  The site is
broken down into the following areas:  (Unix) Flavors, System Administration,
Networking, Security, Software (62 categories), Help,
Conferences/Shows/Events, Vendors, Careers, and Internet. Too much to
describe in a short space.</dd>
