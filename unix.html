    <h2>Unix-Related Sites</h2>
<hr style="height: 2px; width: 100%; margin-left:0px; margin-right:auto;">

I realize there are Linux distributions but there are so many of them,
this page would be too long and complicated if I tried to include them
all.
<p>
I run Raspberry Pi OS on several Raspberry Pi computers and Debian on a
BeagleBone Black. I'm a fan of Debian, and have Ubuntu and Linux Mint
running in several VMs.  They allow me to test various systems. I may
add a few Linux distributions to this page at some point.
<p>
This is a little bit of everything and nothing too intense.  If you are
interested in Unix here are some sites related to unix systems including
awk, sed, vi, vim, and several Unix OS distributions.

<dt><a href="http://www.freebsd.org"><img src="/personal-tech/gif/devil-tiny.gif" alt="">
        <strong>FreeBSD Page</strong></a></dt>
<dd>I run FreeBSD (currently version 14.3-stable) on my Dell Poweredge
servers at home.  FreeBSD is available for many systems, including
i386 (support ends with version 15), amd64, arm64, powerpc64, and
riscv64. One of this free operating system's strong points is TCP/IP
networking. Many application programs are available (freeware and
commercial) as ports and/or "packages" (precompiled binaries packed with
or linked to all the files needed to run the application--installing
packages is as simple as typing "pkg install <em>package-name</em>"). A
large team of individuals continues to contribute actively to the
development of FreeBSD. Includes Linux emulation (currently Rocky Linux).</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.netbsd.org"><strong>NetBSD
Page</strong></a>&nbsp; and&nbsp; 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org"><strong>OpenBSD Page</strong></a></dt>
<dd>NetBSD and OpenBSD are related free unix operating systems (based
on the 4.4BSD-lite distribution, as is FreeBSD), although it is fairly
safe to say now OpenBSD has found its own niche as a secure system.
The NetBSD group tries for maximum portability and stability across
platforms, while the OpenBSD group tries for maximum security while
retaining portability.  These operating systems also are of interest
since their software tends to port (mostly) effortlessly to FreeBSD (and
vice versa).</dd>
