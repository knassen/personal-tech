<H2><STRONG>Aurora Editor Macros</STRONG></H2>
<HR SIZE="3" NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">

Here are Aurora macros, syntax highlighting objects, and functions
written in the Aurora macro language (AML) that may be used to enhance
the functionality and appearance of the Aurora Editor. Files are listed
in four somewhat arbitrary groups: 
<A HREF="#fmacros"><STRONG>[file-related macros]</STRONG></A>, 
<A HREF="#emacros"><STRONG>[miscellaneous editing macros]</STRONG></A>, 
<A HREF="#syntax"><STRONG>[syntax highlighting]</STRONG></A>, and 
<A HREF="#functions"><STRONG>[functions]</STRONG></A>.
<P>
Unless otherwise noted (e.g. <STRONG>.zip</STRONG>), all files are plain
ASCII text files (this is a Unix system). The "--kdn" and "--by kdn" notes indicate 
my specific comments, asides, or files (some of the rest of this page is 
my paraphrasing of what others wrote, but in general this is my original
composition) :-) And yes, I do make (relatively) frequent updates here if 
there are files to add. Check out the changes listed below. Thanks.

<H3><A NAME="fmacros">File-Related Macros</A></H3>

<P><A HREF="aurora/dbflst.aml"><STRONG>DBF File Read</STRONG></A>
Read xBase DBF structures and create comment blocks.

<P><A HREF="aurora/lstfiles.aml"><STRONG>Listfiles v2.2</STRONG></A>. Macro used
to display a list of files being edited WITHOUT displaying the path as
well. This makes jumping from one file to the next a matter of typing
the first letter(s) of the actual file name, unlike the original Aurora
'filelist' function where the path name prevents you from doing that. By
passing an argument to the macro you can display either version of what
the other two files provided. Also added are the following enhancements:
modified the window title to display the total number of files being
edited; added a function to adjust the window size if you're editing a
bunch of files. Modified files are marked with an asterisk. Running the
macro without arguments will allow you to select the arguments you want.
Written by Jim Wilson.

<A HREF="aurora/lstfiles_old3.aml">Listfiles Macro v2.0a</A> /
<A HREF="aurora/lstfiles_old4.aml">Listfiles Macro v2.1</A> /
All superseded by <A HREF="aurora/lstfiles.aml">lstfiles.aml</A> (described 
above). 

<P><A HREF="aurora/mydearc.zip"><STRONG>Uncompress Files from the File Manager</STRONG></A>
An unzipper basically. It supports just about any command-line
archiver/compressor utility. The file 'mydearc.dat' contains the archive
utility definitions. By Steven La. (Packaged as a <STRONG>.zip</STRONG>
file, 5421 bytes)

<P><A HREF="aurora/openfiles.aml"><STRONG>Opening Files Shortcut</STRONG></A>
This macro will open up a regular open prompt, but if you type in
a predefined file-abbreviation, it will load that file.  It needs fewer
keystrokes than filename completion or template expansion.

<P><A HREF="aurora/srchall.aml"><STRONG>Search All Loaded Files</STRONG></A>
Macro used to search for a string of text in all loaded files. If
found, this macro will drop the cursor at the first occurrence in the
first file. Written by Jim Wilson.

<P><A HREF="aurora/superdel.aml"><STRONG>Super Deletion of Files &
Directories</STRONG></A> This macro deletes the file or directory at the
cursor in the current file manager window. This macro will delete
entire directories, including all subdirectories and protected
files.

<P><A HREF="aurora/mytags.zip"><STRONG>An Implementation of Tags for Aurora</STRONG></A>
By Steven La. (Packaged as a <STRONG>.zip</STRONG> file, 4998 bytes)

<P><A HREF="aurora/viewfile.aml"><STRONG>View File from the File Manager</STRONG></A>
Allows you to view a file in a pop up window from the File
Manager before you load it into an edit window.  Also allows you to
extract a file from a .zip WHILE you're viewing it and then place it
directly into an edit window.  Bail out at any time.

<!-- =====================MISC EDITING========================= -->
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
<H3><A NAME="emacros">Miscellaneous Editing Macros</A></H3>

<P><A HREF="aurora/afont.zip"><STRONG>Aurora Fonts (.zip)</STRONG></A>
This implements an ASCII font drawing functionality to Aurora. There
are several files, so this macro is packaged as a <STRONG>.zip</STRONG> file (6597 bytes).

<P><A HREF="aurora/autoexpandv11.aml"><STRONG>AutoExpand Words v1.1</STRONG></A> 
The AUTOEXPD macro will search backwards through your file and find
the first word that would match the character(s) you've typed and
then automatically expand that into the full word. It's sorta
like what the TRAN.AML macro does, but instead of being static
and hard coded like TRAN this one works dynamically. v1.1 is an 
improved version of the AutoExpand macro: faster, more streamlined,
and with a bug fixed.

<P><A HREF="aurora/autoexpandv1.aml"><STRONG>AutoExpand Words v1.0</STRONG></A>
Superseded by <A HREF="aurora/autoexpandv11.aml">autoexpandv11.aml</A>.

<P><A HREF="aurora/clipview.aml"><STRONG>Clipboard Viewer</STRONG></A>
A macro that will allow you to view the contents of any
clipboard in a pop-up window.

<P><A HREF="aurora/mycomp.zip"><STRONG>Run a Compiler/Other Program</STRONG></A>
It doesn't just compile; it runs anything that you pass in as a command.
Gives you a dialog to enter in your command! Pops up a popup with
your error and warning messages. Press enter on an error to go to
the file and line that is in error. By Steven La. (Packaged as a
<STRONG>.zip</STRONG> file, 2109 bytes)

<P><A HREF="aurora/tabopen.aml"><STRONG>Dynamic Tab Expansion</STRONG></A> This
macro is now included in v3 Aurora distribution.  Here it is for people
still using v2.x. Running this macro forces the editor to expand tabs
in newly-opened edit windows.

<P><A HREF="aurora/fillnum.aml"><STRONG>Fill Column Block with Numbers</STRONG></A>
This one's now part of the v3 Aurora installation, but for
people running v2.x here it is.  Quite handy.  Similar to a spreadsheet's
Fill Range command.

<P><A HREF="aurora/windif.aml"><STRONG>Find Window Differences</STRONG></A> Finds
differences between two edit windows.  The windows are tiled
horizontally and from the current cursor position in each window, a
comparison is made character by character. Stops when a difference is
encountered.

<P><A HREF="aurora/fulljust.aml"><STRONG>Full Text Justification</STRONG></A>
I'm not sure where I got this one. It seems to work just fine. Inserts
spaces between words to make each line extend to the right margin.

<P><A HREF="aurora/verthigh.aml"><STRONG>Highlight a Vertical Line</STRONG></A>
Macro used to highlight a vertical line on the screen similar to 
the horizontal line used by syntax highlighting.

<P><A HREF="aurora/newpos.aml"><STRONG>Jump to New Position (newpos.aml)</STRONG></A> 
Jumps to a relative or absolute row or column in the file.  Can handle
percentages (floating-point numbers are allowed).

<P><A HREF="aurora/me-bookmark.aml"><STRONG>Multi-Edit Style Bookmarks (bookmark.aml)</STRONG></A>
Implements a bookmark system like that used by the Multi-Edit
editor.  While the pop-up window is being displayed you merely type any
single letter, number or symbol to set/get a bookmark. Pressing either
&lt;enter&gt; or &lt;space&gt; will cause the 'booklist' macro to run,
displaying what marks you've already set.

<P><A HREF="aurora/real.divide.aml"><STRONG>Real Number Division</STRONG></A> Performs
real number division using integer calculations and returns the result
as a string.

<P><A HREF="aurora/rot13.aml"><STRONG>ROT13 Conversion</STRONG></A> This macro
will substitute the letters of the text in a marked block using the
ROT13 method of substitution.  Use it once to encode text; use it again
to reverse the operation.

<P><A HREF="aurora/sortchr.aml"><STRONG>Sort Lines on a Key</STRONG></A> Sort
lines based on a key following a character in the line.  [I gave this
one a shot the other day and it worked as advertised. I sorted a block
of lines in one of my syntax highlighting files, keying on the "_"
character so that it would sort the public keywords. --kdn]

<P><A HREF="aurora/synch.aml"><STRONG>Window Synchronization</STRONG></A> This
macro allows you to scroll the topmost two windows 'in synch' with each
other. Synchronized scrolling can be toggled ON and OFF with &lt;ctrl f3&gt;.

<!-- =======================HIGHLIGHTING======================= -->
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
<H3><A NAME="syntax">Syntax Highlighting</A></H3>

Note: One thing you will most likely want to do is alter the color
scheme in whatever syntax objects you select here. That's normal, or at
least <STRONG>I</STRONG> could never resist tinkering with the color
schemes. While some of these are my creations, most are not. I've tried
to note the source in all cases. For code that came from the Aurora
mail list, you will most likely need to delete or comment out ("//")
the mail header, signature, and other non-AML text before the file
can be compiled and used. Suggestions/improvements accepted, as well as
other examples.  --kdn

<P><A HREF="aurora/exasm.zip"><STRONG>Assembler Highlighting (.zip)</STRONG></A>
Here is a new version of enhanced syntax highlighting macro for assembly
language programs for the Aurora text editor. It allows for
different colors for mnemonics, registers, assembler directives,
and more. Designed for use with the Netwide Assembler (<A
HREF="http://www.web-sites.co.uk/nasm/">NASM</A>) but will work
with other assemblers as well with little or no modification. Several
files are included, so it is packaged as a <STRONG>.zip</STRONG> file (6869
bytes). Submitted by &lt;MTerlouw@aol.com&gt; (Thanks! --kdn).

<P><A HREF="aurora/xasm.aml"><STRONG>Assembler Highlighting II</STRONG></A>
Another assembly code highlighting object.  Incorporates the newer
opcodes.  Submitted by Matteo Baccan (baccan@isanet.it) (Thanks! --kdn).

<P><A HREF="aurora/xawk.aml"><STRONG>Awk Highlighting v1.1</STRONG></A>
This one's for highlighting awk scripts/programs. Added highlighting by 
type of keyword. Note: I pulled the keywords from the Gawk handbook, so 
some may not apply to all awk interpreters (which shouldn't be a big problem). 
--by kdn

<P><A HREF="aurora/xbtm.aml"><STRONG>4DOS BTM (Batch) File Highlighting</STRONG></A>
4DOS is a command.com replacement that runs under DOS and Windows.
It includes a batch file compilation facility.  Anyway, this is a syntax object
for highlighting the extended batch language provided by 4DOS.
Submitted by Matteo Baccan (baccan@isanet.it) (Thanks! --kdn).  See the 
<A HREF="http://www.jpsoft.com/">JP Software Home Page</A> for further information 
about 4DOS.

<P><A HREF="aurora/euphoria.aml"><STRONG>Euphoria Highlighting</STRONG></A>
Jim Wilson's syntax highlighting object for the Euphoria programming language.
See the <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/FilesEu/index.html">official Euphoria homepage</A> 
for more information such as user contributed
programs, tips, how to register, and a downloadable version of this
programming language. I looked at Euphoria briefly about a year ago, and
while it appears to be everything its creator says it is, I didn't have
time to learn another language. Euphoria isn't free, but it's definitely
worth a look.

<P><A HREF="aurora/html_jw.aml"><STRONG>HTML Highlighting & Translations</STRONG></A>
Jim Wilson's setup for highlighting HTML code. Also includes functions
to add to your tran.aml file which perform translations for HTML code
(you type the first couple characters and the function completes
the beginning tag and adds the ending tag). Also requires a simple
modification to your config.aml file.

<P><A HREF="aurora/xpl.aml"><STRONG>Perl Highlighting v1.1</STRONG></A> A
syntax highlighting object for perl programming. Keywords pulled
from the Perl 5 camel book (hopefully I got most if not all) .
Added colorizing by keyword type. Looks much better now. The <A
HREF="http://www.perl.com/perl/">Perl Language Page</A> provides more
information about Perl. --by kdn

<P><A HREF="aurora/xprg.aml"><STRONG>Clipper Highlighting</STRONG></A>
Syntax highlighting for Clipper's language. Clipper is an xBase
development tool. Submitted by Matteo Baccan (baccan@isanet.it)
(Thanks! --kdn). See the <A HREF="http://www.cai.com/">Computer Associates</A>
site for more information about Clipper and related products.

<P><A HREF="aurora/xpy.aml"><STRONG>Python Highlighting v1.0</STRONG></A>
Syntax highlighting for the Python language. This is a first cut
(meaning mostly untested and maybe missing some keywords) which
includes a lot of functions and commands. . The 
<A HREF="http://www.python.org/">Python Language home page</A> is
one starting point for learning more about Python, an interpreted,
interactive, object-oriented programming language.
--by kdn

<P><A HREF="aurora/xsas.aml"><STRONG>SAS Highlighting v1.0</STRONG></A>
Another quick 'n dirty syntax highlighting object, this time for the
SAS language (SAS is perhaps the ultimate in statistical packages--see the
<A HREF="http://www.sas.com/">SAS home page</A> for more information about SAS).
This one still needs some work, so I'll update it as I go along.  But
right now, it does highlight most of a basic SAS command file, so it is
probably useful for anyone programming in SAS who uses Aurora (SAS is
so huge in terms of number of commands that there is no way this file
contains all of them, so it should be modified for how you use SAS).
--by kdn

<P><A HREF="aurora/xtpl.aml"><STRONG>dBSee Template Highlighting</STRONG></A>
Syntax highlight object for dBsee (Database Software Engineering
Environment) templates (.tpl). Submitted by Matteo Baccan (baccan@isanet.it) (Thanks! --kdn). The 
<A HREF="http://www.dbsee.com/">dBsee Home Page</A> has more information
about dBsee.

<P><A HREF="aurora/unixsyn.aml"><STRONG>Unix Shell Script Highlighting</STRONG></A> 
Syntax highlighting object by Jim Wilson for Bourne shell (sh) script programming.
Should be adaptable to other shells.

ASCII value of current char, and several other items.

<P><A HREF="aurora/smartref.aml"><STRONG>Smart Text Reformatting</STRONG></A>
Quoted text formatting for a block or current paragraph.  By Ingo B.

<P><A HREF="aurora/pageupdown.aml"><STRONG>Improved PageUp and PageDown
Functions</STRONG></A> Makes page up and down work like the top-of-file
and end-of-file keys.  With the end-of-file key (ctrl-pgdn), you always
get a full page of text when you get to the end of the file.  Also, if
you are on the first page and you page up once more, your cursor will
to go to row one.

<P><A HREF="aurora/popup2.aml"><STRONG>Improved Popup Menu</STRONG></A> An
improvement to allow the length of the longest line in the buffer to
determine the menu width in the popup menu. One use for this is as a
replacement for the popup function in the <A HREF="aurora/clipview.aml"><STRONG>Clipboard Viewer</STRONG></A> macro.

<P><A HREF="aurora/ulcase.aml"><STRONG>Smart Upper/Lower Case Conversion
Function</STRONG></A> Change characters or marked blocks to upper or
lowercase.

<P><A HREF="aurora/titlebar.aml"><STRONG>Titlebar Modification
