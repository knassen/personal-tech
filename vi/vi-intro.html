<H2><STRONG>A Short Description of vi</STRONG></H2>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
vi is a full-screen text editor originally written to run under Unix,
but it has been cloned and imitated to run under MS-DOS, Windows,
OS/2, Macintosh OS, Unix, and several other operating systems as well. vi is
unusual in that it has <STRONG>two modes</STRONG>: an <STRONG>input
mode</STRONG> in which text may be inserted, appended, or overwritten,
and a <STRONG>command mode</STRONG> in which the user may issue searches
and/or replacements of text, move around the file being edited, delete
and copy text, perform file operations (read/write/save), and invoke
external system commands (such as the Unix commands <I>sort</I>, 
<I>date</I>, and <I>fmt</I>).
<P>
<STRONG>Up and Running Fast, But Powerful</STRONG><BR>
Basic editing tasks with vi (opening a file, moving around,
inserting text, deleting text, saving the file) can be learned in a few
minutes, but mastering this editor will take much longer since it is
relatively feature-rich and it can draw upon the full power of Unix,
including regular expressions, reading the output of external commands,
and allowing exernal commands to operate on the text being edited, as well
as macros/key mapping, and ex line editor commands.
<P>
<STRONG>Bizarre and Incomprehensible...</STRONG><BR> 
vi can seem rather bizarre, incomprehensible, and confusing to
people just learning it, especially if they are used to single-mode
editors such as the Aurora editor, emacs, the MS-DOS editor, Windows
notepad/wordpad, xedit, Qedit/TSE, Multi-edit, Ultraedit, and the like.
I know it took me a while to get used to the <STRONG>h j k l</STRONG>
cursor keys and switching back and forth between command mode and input
mode using the escape key. At some point, however, if you have the right
sort of sticktoitiveness eventually you stop thinking so much about the
commands you are typing. At that point, you're off to the races.
<P>
<STRONG>...or Fast and Efficient?</STRONG><BR>
vi can be a very fast and efficient editor once you get used to the way
it works. I also like the idea that I can find vi on every Unix system
I've come across (and I use at least four different Unix operating
systems on three different platforms currently), that it is economical
of system resources (such as RAM), that it can do a lot of editing in
very few keystrokes (no mouse required), that it can edit huge files,
and it can operate quite handily over slow modem or internet connections
(which seems to be necessary more often than one would expect).
<P>
<STRONG>The vi Stuff: Get To It, Already!</STRONG><BR>
At this site are some references and links of interest to vi users
and the curious. I've included some screen shots of several popular
vi clones, too, as at least some vee-eyes now offer GUI (graphical)
interfaces with pull-down menus or button bars that might be of interest
to a new generation of potential vi users.
