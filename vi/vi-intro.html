<h2><strong>A Short Description of vi</strong></h2>

<a href="../gif/FreeBSD_14_3_vi.png">FreeBSD_14_3_vi-small.png</a>

<hr style="height: 2px; width: 100%; margin-left:0px;
margin-right:auto;"> vi is a full-screen text editor originally written
to run under Unix, but it has been cloned and imitated to run under
MS-DOS, Windows, OS/2, Macintosh OS, Linux, and several other operating
systems as well. vi is unusual in that it is a <strong>modal</strong>
editor. Its two main modes are an <strong>input mode</strong> in which
text may be inserted, appended, or overwritten, and a <strong>command
mode</strong> in which the user may issue searches and/or replacements
of text, move around the file being edited, delete and copy text,
perform file operations (read/write/save), and invoke external system
commands (such as the Unix commands <i>sort</i>, <i>date</i>, and
<i>fmt</i>).
<p>
<strong>Up and Running Fast, But Powerful</strong><br>
Basic editing tasks with vi (opening a file, moving around,
inserting text, deleting text, saving the file) can be learned in a few
minutes, but mastering this editor will take much longer since it is
relatively feature-rich and it can draw upon the full power of Unix,
including regular expressions, reading the output of external commands,
and allowing exernal commands to operate on the text being edited, as well
as macros/key mapping, and ex line editor commands. ex is another unix
editor, completely command line-based.
<p>
<strong>Bizarre and Incomprehensible...</strong><br> 
vi can seem rather bizarre, incomprehensible, and confusing to
people just learning it, especially if they are used to single-mode
editors such as the Aurora editor, emacs, the MS-DOS editor, Windows
notepad/wordpad, xedit, Qedit/TSE, Multi-edit, Ultraedit, Sublime Text,
and the like. I know it took me a while to get used to the <strong>h j k l</strong>
cursor keys and switching back and forth between command mode and input
mode using the escape key. At some point, however, if you have the right
sort of patience eventually you stop thinking so much about the
commands you are typing. At that point, you're off to the races. Movements
and edits become second nature and ingrained in your fingers.
<p>
<strong>...or Fast and Efficient?</strong><br>
vi can be a very fast and efficient editor once you get used to the
way it works. I also like the idea that I can find vi on every Unix
system I've come across (and at one point I used at least four different
Unix operating systems on three different platforms for work), that
it is economical of system resources (such as RAM), that it can do a
lot of editing in very few keystrokes (no mouse required), that it can
edit huge files, and it can operate quite handily over slow modem or
internet connections (which seems to be necessary more often than one
would expect).
<p>
<strong>The vi Stuff: Get To It, Already!</strong><br>
At this site are some references and links of interest to vi users
and the curious. I've included some screen shots of several popular
vi clones, too, as at least some vee-eyes now offer GUI (graphical)
interfaces with pull-down menus or button bars that might be of interest
to a new generation of potential vi users. See the links at the bottom
of the page. Also see my <a href="/personal-tech/vim/index.html"> Vim
page.
