<strong><a href="http://www.vim.org/">The VIM Home Page</a></strong><br>
VIM is <strong>V</strong>i-<strong>IM</strong>proved, a
<strong>free</strong> vi clone with many extensions and great features
such as multi-level undo, multiple windows and buffers, flexible insert
mode (use the arrow keys to move while in insert mode), visual mode
(execute commands on marked areas of text), block operators (operate
on rectangular blocks of text), and online help system. Vim 5.4 is
currently being tested, and looking good. The new 5.x versions offer bug
fixes and many improvements to the editor in general. In comparison to
Vim 4.x, the 5.x versions offer syntax highlighting for many languages,
a GUI interface (gvim), pull-down menus, an internal scripting language,
and the opportunity to include perl or python as an interpreter. Bram
Moolenaar (mool@oce.nl) is the principal author of VIM and coordinator
of VIM programming efforts.

nvi is the latest incarnation of vi from U.C. Berkeley (it's the vi that
ships with BSD 4.4). nvi is <strong>free</strong> and can use perl as an
extension language. Handles lines longer than 1024 characters now, which
I've found to be a tremendous improvement (many of the vi clones can
also handle really long lines, too). In addition, nvi supports multiple
buffers, unlimited undo, is 8 bit clean, and has command-line editing
and filename completion. Current version is 1.79. Nothing fancy about
the way nvi looks...plain ol' vi in a terminal window; I didn't expect
you'd need a screen shot of that. Also included at this site is the vi
FAQ.

Elvis (ftp)</a></strong><br>
Elvis <a href="../gif/elvis21c3.gif">[V2.0 SCREEN SHOT 14K GIF]</a>is
a <strong>free</strong> vi clone written by Steve Kirkendall
(kirkenda@cs.pdx.edu) that offers multiple buffers, multiple windows,
and multiple display modes. In its most recent incarnation (beta test
v2.1g -- this is the first 2.1 beta, meaning all 2.1 features have been
added and the only changes will be bug fixes) it provides a very nice
X11 interface with a user-definable button bar, syntax highlighting,
pop-up dialog windows, and hex editing. Elvis 2.1 can view and print a
significant subset of HTML (its help system is written in HTML). This
editor has come a long way in the last year or so, so if you haven't
tried it recently, you should now. Version 2.0 is the most recent
release version (binaries are available for MS-DOS and Win32, source
code for Unix). Version 2.0 has most of the features of 2.1, although
the menubar has become more versatile in 2.1 (the 2.1 beta version is in
the "unreleased" directory). As of Oct 20, 2002, Elvis 2.2 has been
released.

<strong><a href="https://invisible-island.net/vile/">
Vile and XVile</a></strong><br>
vile stands for "vi like emacs." It is a <strong>free</strong>
vi-like editor with many emacs-like features. It has a very vi-like
"finger feel" according to its author, although it does not attempt
to be a complete vi clone. vile includes multi-file editing and
viewing, key rebinding, mouse support (in an xterm, or when built
as xvile), infinite undo, selection highlighting, rectangular
operations, "next error" cursor positioning after compilation, full
function-key and arrow-key support, filename &amp; command completion,
command/search string/filename history, auxiliary utilities for man
page and C program syntax highlighting, built-in macro language,
and an interface to Perl. vile ports to all UNIX platforms,
VMS, and DOS. xvile <a href="../gif/xvile72.gif">[SCREEN SHOT 11K GIF]</a> 
is the X11 version of vile, which adds scrollbars, more
complete mouse capabilities, and menus when Athena or Motif widget
libraries are available. vile and xvile were reviewed in the
<a href="http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue01to08/xvile_mar96.html">
March 1996 Linux Gazette.</a>  Vile is available for DOS, Win95/NT,
OS/2, and as source code for Unix and other operating systems.

Lemmy: A Unix vi for Windows 95 and NT [bad
link]</a></strong><BR> Lemmy <a href="../gif/lemmy20.gif">[V2.0
SCREEN SHOT 15K GIF]</a>is a rather interesting twist on the
vi theme. It is a vi editor with a windows interface for 
<a href="../gif/lemmy3.gif">Win 95 &amp; NT [V3 SCREEN SHOT 10K GIF]</a>
(and until recently, Win32s--couldn't find that version last time I
looked). Custom (fixed-pitch) fonts, unlimited undo/redo, user-definable
&amp; extendable syntax highlighting, and the obligatory Windows-style
pull down menus are available, among other features. This is another vi
clone that has seen lots of improvement in the past year. The author is
James Iuliano, who keeps some lemmy information and tips at his home
page. Lemmy v3.0, however, is now being marketed by Software Online,
Ltd. and a single-user license, which removes nags and affords free
upgrades, costs $20 (other licenses available).

WinVi for Win95/NT and Win 3.1</a>
</strong><BR>
WinVi <a href="../gif/winvi263.jpg">[V2.63 on Win95 SCREEN SHOT 60K JPG]</a> 
is a <strong>free</strong> Windows vi clone that was designed
to be compatible with the Windows Notepad editor. It offers such
features as fast startup (does not use DLLs), can edit files as large as
virtual memory, background may be set to a bitmap image, and selectable
(including True Type) fonts. This editor is still in the relatively
early stages of development and does lack true vi compatibility. For
example, macros &amp; abbreviations are not available currently. Also, only
one active file can be edited for each instance of WinVi running. Still,
this is another interesting adaptation of vi to the Windows environment
and one to watch as it improves. Versions are available for 16-bit and
32-bit Windows. Development has stopped for Windows versions older than
Win 2000. WinVI v3.02 was released Mar 18, 2012.

<strong><a href="https://martinwguy.github.io/xvi/">
xvi v2.50</a></strong><BR>
According to its authors: "Xvi <a href="../gif/xvi219.gif">[SCREEN SHOT 8K GIF]</a>
is a portable <strong>free</strong> multi-window version of
`vi'. In spite of its name, there is, as yet, no X-Windows-specific
version of it, but work is reputedly still in progress. Existing
versions use text windows separated by horizontal status lines
on character mode displays. The windows may represent different
files being edited, or different views on to the same file." The
source code is available <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/xvi/">
    on sourceforge</a>
<!--Here is a local copy of the source for xvi 2.19: 
<a href="xvi219.tgz">xvi219.tgz</a-->.

<p>Xvi was actually my first vi clone experience. It hooked me
with its multiple windows and ability to cut and paste between
windows. Unfortunately, xvi had a number of incompatibilities with
"true" vi, so I moved on to other clones, and of course, true vi. xvi
is still a very useful editor with some handy features, including a
small memory usage and multiple buffers.  It is still maintained and has
improved a lot in the last 20 years.

JAVI [bad link]</a></strong><BR>
An implementation of vi in Java.  Can be run as an applet or an application.

<p>[The screen shots above, with the exception
of the Lemmy and WinVi screen shots (which were grabbed while running
Windows 3.1 or Win 95), were grabbed while each application was running under
<a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.terraware.net/ftp/pub/Mirrors/FVWM95/fvwm95.html">FVWM-95</a> 
window manager. Elvis, and xvile obviously have been set to
similar color schemes in my .Xdefaults file.]
