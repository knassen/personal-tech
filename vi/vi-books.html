<h2>vi Books</h2>

<hr style="height: 2px; width: 100%; margin-left:0px; margin-right:auto;">
I own published copies of both of these books, and I find each of them excellent
in its own way. The Lamb book is what I started with...well, actually, I
started with the brief vi and ex command summaries in the 1990 printing
of <u>Unix in a Nutshell</u> by <a href="http://www.ora.com/">O'Reilly
&amp; Associates</a> and puzzled my way along until I got Lamb's book. I
purchased the H-P book later, after I already knew enough to get through
a work day using vi without looking at a manual, but that book has still
been useful for its clear explanations.

    <dt><span style="font-size=: 115%;">Hewlett-Packard Company (1990,

    <dd>11 Chapters, plus an appendix on regular expressions. This book takes
    a task-oriented approach to teaching the use of the vi and ex editors
    and includes many examples.</dd>

    <a href="http://www.ora.com/">O'Reilly &amp; Associates</a>), 348 pp.
        </span> </dt>
        <dd>Starts with a beginner's tutorial and works up to using ex,
global replacement, and advanced editing techniques. The 6th edition
now includes information on several vi-clones: nvi, elvis, vim, and
vile. The 8th edition has been out for a while by Arnold Robbins, Elbert
Hanna, and Linda Lamb.</dd>

<p>Also of interest for vi users is:

    <dt><span style="font-size=: 115%;">
    Friedl, Jeffrey E.F., <U>Mastering Regular Expressions</U> (Sebastapol, CA:
    O'Reilly &amp; Associates), 340+ pp.</span></dt>
<dd>This must be the most comprehensive tutorial and reference
about regular expressions published to-date. It includes in-depth
explanations of how regular expressions do their work and many
descriptions of the various unix tools that incorporate regular
expressions (such as vi).  This book really gets to the method behind
the madness of regular expressions and is an excellent reference.</dd>
