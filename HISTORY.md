## My Former WebSite

**This is my former website at umich.edu**. As of sometime in 2024, they
decided to remove the AFS system, so it got deleted when that system
went away. They were kind enough to zip up my files so I could download
them before they disappeared. I never expected it to stay up for 25
years, but it did, and that was mostly due to the university keeping
our accounts going.

My umich.edu website was where I put many of the **Perl programs** I
wrote over the years. They still work, as far as I can tell.  Some were
for my job at ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for Political and
Social Research at UM) when I worked there. We were always getting new
study data submissions to add to the archives there. But there were many
checks and much documentation creation to get the data fully described.
This included creating SAS and SPSS programs to read the data to make
it useful for users. You'll see a few Perl programs that were used for
those tasks.

At some point, I learned about **FIGlet, a program to create large
letters from ASCII characters**. There is an area of this site devoted
to FIGlet fonts, including ones I either created or converted.  When
USENET was a busy place, there were ASCII-art groups. Occasionally,
someone would post a font they had created, but didn't have the time
or knowledge to convert to a FIGlet font, so often I'd take on the
conversion. Some fonts came from email signatures that included ASCII
art letters. Those would take more effort because they were often
missing most of the alphabet.

**July 6, 2025**: Since uploading it to GitHub, I've been going through
all the 404 errors and trying to find if they relocated to a different
site or if they just disappeared into the ether. Some sites are still
out there, so I linked to their new locations. Other sites are gone. I'm
initially marking them as "bad link" while I search for replacements. If
I can't find a replacement link, that link gets deleted.

Many projects that used to be accessible from personal servers,
university accounts, or commercial server accounts have moved to
SourceForge and GitHub in the past 10-20 years. If I can find them, I've
been updating my links.

Some the of software archives are completely gone, but some had mirrors
that are still available, so I've added those mirror links. How long
they'll continue to work is anyone's guess.

It is interesting to see how links and information degrade over the
decades. As we all know, the WWW is very often impermanent. Even
when this site was being managed regularly, links would turn up not
working after a few months and need to be replaced. Also interesting
is that some websites still operate after all this time with similar
content. This varies by subject area. Things like my Figlet and Vim
pages have many bad links.  But the statistics links were relatively
unscathed by bit rot (including stat packages). Fads come and go but
math is math.

**July 13, 2025**: I began converting to HTML5 format for the web pages.
It's going to be a big task, even if switching from font to span is
easy. 

**July 15, 2025**: HTML5 conversion has been completed in the vi pages
and is mostly done in the Perl pages.  Plenty more to do.

**July 18, 2025**: HTML5 conversion is mostly done for the first pass
through everything.  I'll still be tweaking as I review things.
One thing I found interesting was that the statistics links had a high
proportion of working links compared to other domains.

**July 21, 2025**: Running out of HTML5 tweaks for lingering issues
in HTML5.

**July 30, 2025**: I'm checking html files with tidy5 and fixing any
warnings and errors.  At this point, every file is passing the tidy5
tests for HTML5. This doesn't mean it looks good, though.

**August 2, 2025**: I'm going through the web pages again and fixing
formatting issues.  These issues are not such that the page can't
be read.  They are more likely to be spacing and horizontal rule placement
issues. I've found at least two dozen such issues and will likely find
other issues along the way. I'm still finding one occasionally that
needs to be converted to HTML5, but they are getting scarce.

**August 3, 2025**: I finally found the zip file of my site
that I downloaded. I was cleaning up duplicate and old zip files in
my Downloads directory and there it was. So now, other than HTML5
conversions, I'm looking at old pages and seeing if there is any content
missing on this site.  It's quite a bit easier than sifting through the
WayBack Machine outputs, but now I have the actual code. If I need to do
something the same way, I can do so easily. The big thing will be seeing
if there are any pages that I don't already have.

**August 13, 2025**: I am at the point where I'm tweaking content and
formatting occasionally. The HTML5 conversion is done and validated
by tidy5. I added more Perl programs to the site. I verified the site
with google. And I added a sitemap.xml file. I'm hoping that helps
Google find these pages. I worked at getting Google to index my pages,
but it is either glacially slow or not being done. I submitted a few
pages manually from the Google Search Console, asking for indexing, and
that helped. I was able to get to three pages via a Google search, so
hopefully the rest of it will get indexed.

**August 15, 2025**: I've added more Perl programs to the Perl page.
Whether they are useful to you, depends on what kind of work you do
and what your needs are.  There are programs like cktb, which checks
for trailing blanks on the lines of a file or program. Or detab, which
can be used to replace tabs with spaces two different ways. Deblank is
another one, which coverts multiple blank lines in a file to single
blank lines. Finally, I added qscan, an update of the 40scan program
for finding the lengths of quoted strings in files or programs with the
ability to set a line length via the command line.

**August 25, 2025**: I've been working on the otherfonts.html page,
adding buttons for previews. This allows opening one preview or several
and comparing on the same page. To close the preview, click on the
preview button again.  No need to leave the font list page and come
back. One thing this has been good for is finding minor issues in font
sample files, and typos in URLs. Things are getting better as I go down
the list.

**August 26, 2025**: otherfonts.html is updated for preview dropdowns
now.  Click the button and a preview appears.  Click it again and the
preview goes away. I may work on the spacing at some point, but all
seems to work as expected.

**August 29, 2025** I've updated the figlet pages for content.  Many
broken links are now commented out or replaced with good links. It's a
process...

**September 6, 2025** I've been trying to get google to index some
of the main pages on this site. And I've been adding code to help
with mobile viewing and accessibility.
