## My Former Web Site

**This is my former web site at umich.edu**. As of sometime in 2024, they
decided that alumni don't get web sites anymore, so they deleted it.
I was able to find most of the code on my local computer because I
developed it there and uploaded it. But some changes were done on the
umich server directly so I didn't have them locally. I got those from
the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine and added them to the local
codes. It wasn't much, thankfully.

My umich.edu web site was where I put many of the **Perl programs** I wrote
over the years. They still work, as far as I can tell.  Some were for
my job at ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social
Research at UM). We were always getting new study data submissions
to add to the archives there. But there were many checks and much
documentation creation to get the data fully described.  This included
creating SAS and SPSS programs to read the data to make it useful for
users. You'll see a few Perl programs that were used for those tasks.

At some point I learned about **FIGlet, a program to create large letters
from ASCII characters**. There is an area of this site devoted to FIGlet
fonts including ones I either created or converted.  When UseNet was a
busy place, there were ASCII-art groups and often someone would post a
font they had created, but didn't have the time to convert to a FIGlet
font, so often I'd take on the conversion. Some fonts came from e-mail
signatures that included ASCII art letters. Those would take more effort
because they were often missing most of the alphabet.

**July 6, 2025**: Since uploading it to github I've been going through all
the 404 errors and trying to finding if they relocated to a different
site or if they just disappe:spared into the ether. Some sites are still
out there so I linked to their new locations.

Many projects that used to be accessible from personal servers or other
commercial server accounts, have moved to sourceforge and github in the
past 10 years. If I can find them, I've been updating my links.

**July 13, 2025**: I began converting to HTML5 format for the web pages.
It's going to be a big task even if switching from font to span is
easy. 

**July 15, 2025**: HTML5 conversion has been completed in the vi pages
and mostly done in the Perl pages.  Plenty more to do.

**July 18, 2025**: HTML5 conversion is mostly done for the first pass
through everything.  I'll still be tweaking as I review things.
One thing I found interesting was that the statistics links had a high
proportion of working links compared to other domains.

**July 21, 2025**: Running out of HTML5 tweaks for lingering issues
in HTML5.
