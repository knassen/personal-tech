# personal-tech

This is my university personal website, which was deleted in 2024
when they shut down the AFS system.

It is now at: https://knassen.github.io/personal-tech/

I've mostly recreated it. I found most of the HTML files on my local
hard drive (though they were not always the most recent).  I did some
lookups on the Wayback Machine to fill in for additions and changes that
were made directly on the server rather than in my local files.  I also
found the backup the university had made for me so that was the biggest
help. I'm reasonably confident it is mostly all back.

I still have plenty to do.

  - Some of the links are bad and need to be fixed or replaced. I've
    been marking bad links and replacing ones I can find in other
    sites. Thankfully, some of the old sites still exist.
 
    - I've got the Figlet pages up and working, with font examples.
      I also added all the Figlet fonts I had and put them in a
      list, where you can see an example of the font, and/or download
      it.
    - I've got my Perl programs back up and have added several more
      to the list including the cklg SAS log checker.
    - I've got my vi and vim pages up and working.
    - The Aurora Editor pages are up and working. They are mainly
      for historical reference since this editor is no longer sold
      or supported.

  - I'm working on updating information where I see it is out of date.
    Some information is surprisingly still relevant after 25 years.

  - I may add some additional Perl programs of general interest. For example,
    I recently added the cklg SAS log checking program to the Perl page.
    This cklg program is one I updated last year because it was 
    complaining about using old-style code. It should work fine now.

  - I'm done converting the site to HTML5 standards. This may result in
    odd page formatting that is yet to be fixed.

  - I still have the Internet Archive for comparisons if I need it.  The
    Vim functions for SAS programming were one such retrieval that was
    not in my local files. It also led to the main index.html page being
    updated with a new image and an adjustment of content.

There are still some good and interesting items here, even if they are
ancient in computer terms. No AIs were around to help when this site was
set up originally. However, you can see how things used to be done.

I hope you will find a few things here that are worthwhile. And maybe
they will give you some ideas for utilities of your own. I still use
some of these programs.
