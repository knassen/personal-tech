This is my university personal website, which was deleted in 2024.

I've tried recreating it. I found most of the HTML files on
my local hard drive (though they were not always the most recent).  I 
did some lookups on the Wayback Machine to fill in for additions and
changes that were made directly on the server rather than in my local files. 
I'm reasonably confident it is mostly all back.

I've still got plenty to do.

  - A lot of the links are bad and need to be fixed or replaced. I've
    been marking bad links and replacing ones I can find in other
    sites. Thankfully, some of the old sites still exist.

  - Some of the information needs to be updated and brought up to date.
    Some information is surprisingly still relevant after 25 years.

  - I may add some additional Perl programs of general interest. For example,
    I recently added the cklg SAS log checking program to the Perl page.

  - I'm done converting the site to HTML5 standards. This may result in odd page formatting
    that has yet to be fixed.
  
  - I'm still comparing to the Internet Archive for things I may have
    missed. The Vim functions for SAS programming were one such retrieval
    that weren't in my local files.

There are still some good and interesting items here, even if they are 
ancient in computer terms. Just remember: no AIs were around to help when 
this site was set up originally. At least, you can see how things used
to be done.

I hope you will find a few things here that are worthwhile. I still use
some of these programs.
