# personal-tech
My university personal web site which got deleted in 2024.

This is my attempt at recreating it.  I found most of the html files on my
local hard drive.  I did some lookups on the Wayback Machine to fill in for
additions that were made directly on the web site rather than in my local
files.

At this point it is mostly all there.

There is more to do:

  - A lot of links are bad and need to fixed or replaced. I've been marking
    bad links and replacing ones I can find in other sites.
  - Some of the information needs to be updated.
  - I've been converting to HTML5 standards but there's more of that to do.

There are still some good items here.  Even for historical value it can be
useful. 

I hope you find a few things here that are worthwhile.
