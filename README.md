# personal-tech

This is my university personal website, which was deleted in 2024
when their AFS system was shut down.

It is now at: https://knassen.github.io/personal-tech/

I've recreated it. Thankfully I found the backup the university had made
for me so that was a huge help. I'm reasonably confident the site is all
back.

This site includes Figlet fonts, Perl programs for various data
processing tasks, information about the old Aurora Text Editor, vi and
vim editor pages, links to Unix/Linux sites, links related to Apple 2 
sites, and statistical links.

I have done most of things I set out to do.

  - I've cleaned up most of the bad links and tried to replace them.
    Thankfully, some of the old sites still exist.
 
  - I've updated information where I saw it was out of date.  Some
    information is surprisingly still relevant after 25 years.  I've
    been removing a lot of stuff that no longer exists or is not very
    useful.

  - I'm still thinking of additional content to create, including more
    examples, more screenshots, and maybe some Python code I've been
    working on.

  - I added some additional Perl programs of general interest. For
    example, I recently added the cklg SAS log checking program to the
    Perl page.  Obviously, if you don't use SAS it's probably not much
    use, but it could potentially be updated for log error messages from
    other languages. I also got the Vim functions for SAS programming
    page back.

  - I'm done converting the site to HTML5 standards. I've fixed most of
    the page formatting. 

  - Pages are mostly updated for spacing issues and content and the
    issues list is done.

  - Most pages are updated for language and viewport settings now. The
    latter should make them look better on mobile devices.

  - I made an effort to get many of the pages indexed on google so
    they'll stand a better chance of showing up in searches.

I hope you will find a few things here that are worthwhile. Maybe they
will give you some ideas for utilities of your own or remind you of
ways to do things in SAS, vim, or unix/linux. I still use some of these
programs.
