# personal-tech
This is my university personal website, which was deleted in 2024.

It is now: https://knassen.github.io/personal-tech/

I've mostly recreated it. I found most of the HTML files on
my local hard drive (though they were not always the most recent).  I 
did some lookups on the Wayback Machine to fill in for additions and
changes that were made directly on the server rather than in my local files. 
I'm reasonably confident it is mostly all back.

I still have plenty to do.

  - A lot of the links are bad and need to be fixed or replaced. I've
    been marking bad links and replacing ones I can find in other
    sites. Thankfully, some of the old sites still exist.
 
    - I've got the Figlet pages up and working, with font examples.
    = I've got my Perl programs back up and have added four more
      to the list including the cklg SAS log checker.
    - I've got my vi and vim pages up and working.
    - The Aurora Editor pages are up and working. They are mainly
      for historical reference.

  - Some of the information needs to be updated and brought up to date.
    Some information is surprisingly still relevant after 25 years.

  - I may add some additional Perl programs of general interest. For example,
    I recently added the cklg SAS log checking program to the Perl page.
    And this is the cklg program I updated last year because it was 
    complaining about using old-style code. It should work fine now.

  - I'm done converting the site to HTML5 standards. This may result in
    odd page formatting that is yet to be fixed.

  - I found a backup of my web site from just prior to it being deleted.
    This makes some things much easier, although I still would have had
    to go through the conversion to HTML5. The main thing is I got all
    the files back, including things that were linked to in the original
    web pages.

  - I still have the Internet Archive for comparisons if I need it.  The
    Vim functions for SAS programming were one such retrieval that was
    not in my local files. It also led to the main index.html page being
    updated with a new image and an adjustment of content.

There are still some good and interesting items here, even if they are 
ancient in computer terms. No AIs were around to help when 
this site was set up originally. At least, you can see how things used
to be done.

I hope you will find a few things here that are worthwhile. And maybe
they will give you some ideas. I still use some of these programs.
