# personal-tech

This is my university personal website, which was deleted in 2024
when they shut down the AFS system.

It is now at: https://knassen.github.io/personal-tech/

I've recreated it. Thankfully I found the backup the university had made
for me so that was a huge help. I'm reasonably confident the site is all
back.

I still have some things to do.

  - I've cleaned up most of the bad links and replaced them.
    Thankfully, some of the old sites still exist.
 
  - I'm working on updating information where I see it is out of date.
    Some information is surprisingly still relevant after 25 years.
    I've been removing a lot of stuff that no longer exists or is
    not very useful.
    
  - I'm thinking of additional content to add, including more examples,
    more screenshots, and maybe some Python code I've been working on.

  - I added some additional Perl programs of general interest. For
    example, I recently added the cklg SAS log checking program to the
    Perl page.  This cklg program is one I updated last year because it
    was complaining about using old-style code. It should work fine now.
    Obviously, if you don't run SAS it's probably not much use, but it
    could be potentially updated for error messages from other languages
    (Vim's quickfix should handle many languages as-is). I also got the
    Vim functions for SAS programming back.

  - I'm done converting the site to HTML5 standards. I've fixed most of
    the page formatting. 

  - Pages are mostly updated now for spacing issues and content and
    the issues list is getting shorter. 

  - Most pages are updated for language and viewport settings now. The
    latter should make them look better on a mobile device.

I hope you will find a few things here that are worthwhile. And maybe
they will give you some ideas for utilities of your own or remind you of
ways to do things in unix/linux. I still use some of these programs.
