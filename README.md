# personal-tech

This is my university personal website, which was deleted in 2024
when they shut down the AFS system.

It is now at: https://knassen.github.io/personal-tech/

I've recreated it. I found most of the HTML files on my local hard drive
(though they were not always the most recent).  I did some lookups on
the Wayback Machine to fill in for additions and changes that were made
directly on the server rather than in my local files.  I also found the
backup the university had made for me so that was the biggest help. I'm
reasonably confident the site is all back.

I still have some things to do.

  - Some of the links are bad and need to be fixed or replaced. I've
    been marking bad links and replacing ones I can find in other
    sites. Thankfully, some of the old sites still exist.
 
  - I'm working on updating information where I see it is out of date.
    Some information is surprisingly still relevant after 25 years.
    
  - I'm thinking of additional content to add, including more examples,
    more screenshots, and maybe some Python code I've been working on.

  - I added some additional Perl programs of general interest. For
    example, I recently added the cklg SAS log checking program to the
    Perl page.  This cklg program is one I updated last year because it
    was complaining about using old-style code. It should work fine now.
    Obviously, if you don't run SAS it's probably not much use, but it
    could be potentially updated for error messages from other languages
    (Vim's quickfix should handle many languages as-is). I also got the
    Vim functions for SAS programming back.

  - I'm done converting the site to HTML5 standards. I've fixed most of
    the page formatting. 

  - Pages are mostly updated now for spacing issues and content and
    the issues are getting less and less. 

There are still some good and interesting items here, even if they are
ancient in computer terms. No AIs were around to help when this site was
set up originally. However, you can see how things used to be done.

I hope you will find a few things here that are worthwhile. And maybe
they will give you some ideas for utilities of your own or remind you of
ways to do things in unix/linux. I still use some of these programs.
