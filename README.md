# personal-tech
This is my university personal web site which got deleted in 2024.

I've made an attempt at recreating it. I found most of the html files on
my local hard drive.  I did some lookups on the Wayback Machine to fill
in for additions that were made directly on the web site rather than in
my local files. So, I'm reasonably confident it is all back.

I've still got plenty to do.

  - A lot of the links are bad and need to fixed or replaced. I've
    been marking bad links and replacing ones I can find in other
    sites. Thankfully, some of the old sites still exist.

  - Some of the information needs to be updated and brought up to date.
    Some information is surprisingly still relevant after 25 years.

  - I may add some additional Perl programs of general interest.

  - I've mostly converted the site to HTML5 standards. This may lead to
    some odd formatting yet to be fixed.

There are still some good items here, even if they are ancient in
computer terms. Just remember: no AIs were around to help when this site
was set up originally.

I hope you will find a few things here that are worthwhile.
