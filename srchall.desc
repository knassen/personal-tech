  Subject: Two new macros

  - SRCHALL
    This macro will search all your open files for a string. I have had
    occasion to use this when searching for a variable name in a bunch
    of open files. It will work on every file you have loaded, and will
    stop at the first occurrence it finds. Note that there is one
    problem; if srchall happens to find the search string in the
    _ClipBoard it will cause weird things to happen (something which
    simulates a lockup is usually what occurs). I have put logic in the
    macro to prevent it from searching the _ClipBoard, but it doesn't
    seem to work all of the time. Go figure...
